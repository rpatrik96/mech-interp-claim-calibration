                                       ABSTRACT2022
                             Research in mechanistic interpretability seeks to explain behaviors of machine
                                 learning (ML) models in terms of their internal components.  However, most
                               previous work either focuses on simple behaviors in small models or describesNov
                              complicated behaviors in larger models with broad strokes.  In this work, we
1                         bridge this gap by presenting an explanation for how GPT-2 small performs a
                                  natural language task called indirect object identiﬁcation (IOI). Our explana-
                                  tion encompasses 26 attention heads grouped into 7 main classes, which we
                               discovered using a combination of interpretability approaches relying on causal
                                  interventions.  To our knowledge, this investigation is the largest end-to-end
                               attempt at reverse-engineering a natural behavior “in the wild” in a language
                             model. We evaluate the reliability of our explanation using three quantitative[cs.LG]
                                    criteria–faithfulness, completeness and minimality.  Though these criteria sup-
                                 port our explanation, they also point to remaining gaps in our understanding.
                          Our work provides evidence that a mechanistic understanding of large ML mod-
                                    els is feasible, pointing toward opportunities to scale our understanding to both
                                   larger models and more complex tasks. Code for all experiments is available at

                1  INTRODUCTION

                      Transformer-based language models (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020) have demonstrated
                     an impressive suite of capabilities but largely remain black boxes. Understanding these models is
                         difﬁcult because they employ complex non-linear interactions in densely-connected layers and op-
                         erate in a high-dimensional space. Despite this, they are already deployed in high-impact settings
                    (Zhang et al., 2022; Caldarini et al., 2022), underscoring the urgency of understanding and antici-
                       pating possible model behaviors. Some researchers have argued that interpretability is critical forarXiv:2211.00593v1
                        the safe deployment of advanced machine learning systems (Hendrycks & Mazeika, 2022).

                  Work in mechanistic interpretability aims to discover, understand, and verify the algorithms that
                   model weights implement by reverse engineering model computation into human-understandable
                    components (Olah, 2022; Meng et al., 2022; Geiger et al., 2021; Geva et al., 2020). By understanding
                      underlying mechanisms, we can better predict out-of-distribution behavior (Mu & Andreas, 2020),
                         identify and ﬁx model errors (Hernandez et al., 2021; Vig et al., 2020), and understand emergent
                      behavior (Nanda & Lieberum, 2022; Barak et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).

                       In this work, we aim to mechanistically understand how GPT-2 small (Radford et al., 2019) im-
                      plements a simple natural language task. We do so by using circuit analysis (R¨auker et al., 2022),
                        identifying an induced subgraph of the model’s computational graph that is human-understandable
                    and responsible for completing the task.

                   To discover the circuit, we introduce a systematic approach that iteratively traces important compo-
                       nents back from the logits, using a causal intervention that we call “path patching”. We supplement
                           this mainline approach with projections in the embedding space, attention pattern analysis, and ac-
                          tivation patching to understand the behavior of each component.

Figure 1: Left: We isolated a circuit (in orange) responsible for the ﬂow of information connecting
the indirect object “Mary” to the next token prediction. The nodes are attention layers and the edges
represent the interactions between these layers. Right: We discovered and validated this circuit using
causal interventions, including both path patching and knockouts of attention heads.


We focus on understanding a speciﬁc natural language task that we call indirect object identiﬁcation
(IOI). In IOI, sentences such as “When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to”
should be completed with “Mary”. We chose this task because it is linguistically meaningful and
admits an interpretable algorithm: of the two names in the sentence, predict the name that isn’t the
subject of the last clause.

We discover a circuit of 26 attention heads–1.1% of the total number of (head, token position)
pairs–that completes the bulk of this task. The circuit uses 7 categories of heads (see Figure 2) to
implement the algorithm. Together, these heads route information between different name tokens,
to the end position, and ﬁnally to the output. Our work provides, to the best of our knowledge, the
most detailed attempt at reverse-engineering an end-to-end behavior in a transformer-based language
model.

By zooming in on a crisp task in a particular model, we obtained several insights about the challenges
of mechanistic interpretability. In particular:

• We identiﬁed several instances of heads implementing redundant behavior (Michel et al., 2019).
  The most surprising were “Backup Name-Mover Heads”, which copy names to the correct posi-
   tion in the output, but only when regular Name-Mover Heads are ablated. This complicates the
  search for complete mechanisms, as different model structure is found when some components
  are ablated.
• We found known structures (speciﬁcally induction heads (Elhage et al., 2021)) that were used in
  unexpected ways. Thus mainline functionality of a component does not always give a full picture.
• Finally, we identiﬁed heads reliably writing in the opposite direction of the correct answer.

Explanations for model behavior can easily be misleading or non-rigorous (Jain & Wallace, 2019;
Bolukbasi et al., 2021). To remedy this problem, we formulate three criteria to help validate our
circuit explanations. These criteria are faithfulness (the circuit can perform the task as well as
the whole model), completeness (the circuit contains all the nodes used to perform the task), and
minimality (the circuit doesn’t contain nodes irrelevant to the task). Our circuit shows signiﬁcant
improvements compared to a na¨ıve (but faithful) circuit, but fails to pass the most challenging tests.

In summary, our main contributions are: (1) We identify a large circuit in GPT-2 small that performs
indirect-object identiﬁcation (Figure 2 and Section 3); (2) Through example, we identify useful
techniques for understanding models, as well as surprising pitfalls; (3) We present criteria that ensure
structural correspondence between the circuit and the model, and check experimentally whether our
circuit meets this standard (Section 4).


2  BACKGROUND


In this section, we introduce the IOI task, review the transformer architecture, deﬁne circuits more
formally, and describe a technique for “knocking out” nodes in a model.


                                       2

Task description. A sentence containing indirect object identiﬁcation (IOI) has an initial dependent
clause, e.g “When Mary and John went to the store”, and a main clause, e.g “John gave a bottle of
milk to Mary”. The initial clause introduces the indirect object (IO) “Mary” and the subject (S)
“John”. The main clause refers to the subject a second time, and in all our examples of IOI, the
subject gives an object to the IO. The IOI task is to predict the ﬁnal token in the sentence to be the
IO. We use ‘S1’ and ‘S2’ to refer to the ﬁrst and second occurrences of the subject, when we want
to specify position. We create dataset samples for IOI using 15 templates (see Appendix E) with
random single-token names, places and items. We use the notation pIOI for the distribution over
sentences generated by this procedure.

To quantify GPT-2 small’s performance on the IOI task, we use two different metrics: logit differ-
ence and IO probability. Logit difference measures the difference in logit value between the two
names, where a positive score means the correct name (IO) has higher probability. IO probability
measures the absolute probability of the IO token under the model’s predictions. Both metrics are
averaged over pIOI. Over 100,000 dataset examples, GPT-2 small has mean logit difference of 3.56
(IO predicted over S 99.3% of the time), and mean IO probability of 49%.

Transformer architecture. GPT-2 small is a decoder-only transformer with 12 layers and 12 at-
tention heads per attention layer. In this work, we mostly focus on understanding the behavior of
attention heads, which we describe below using notation similar to Elhage et al. (2021). We leave a
full description of the model to Appendix G.
The input x0 to the transformer is a sum of position and token embeddings and lies in RN×d, where
N is the number of tokens in the input and d is the model dimension. This input embedding is the
initial value of the residual stream, which all attention layers and MLPs read from and write to.
Attention layer i of the network takes as input xi ∈RN×d, the value of the residual stream at layer
i. The attention layer output can be decomposed into the sum of attention heads hi,j. If the output
of the attention layer is yi = Pj hi,j(xi), then the residual stream is updated to xi + yi.
Focusing on individual heads, each head hi,j is parametrized by four matrices W Qi,j , W Ki,j , W Oi,j ∈
Rd× Hd and W Vi,j ∈R d                                                                                                  i,j                H ×d. We rewrite these parameters as low-rank matrices in Rd×d: W OV =
W Oi,j W Vi,j and W QKi,j = W Qi,j (W Ki,j )T . The QK matrix is used to compute the attention pattern
Ai,j ∈RN×N of head (i, j), while the OV matrix determines what is written into the residual
stream. At the end of the forward pass, a layer norm is applied before the unembed matrix WU
projects the residual stream into logits.


2.1  CIRCUITS AND KNOCKOUTS

In mechanistic interpretability, we want to understand the correspondence between the components
of a model and human-understandable concepts. A useful abstraction for this goal is circuits. If we
think of a model as a computational graph M where nodes are terms in its forward pass (neurons,
attention heads, embeddings, etc.) and edges are the interactions between those terms (residual con-
nections, attention, projections, etc.), a circuit C is a subgraph of M responsible for some behavior
(such as completing the IOI task). This deﬁnition of a circuit is more coarse-grained than the one
presented in Olah et al. (2020), where nodes are features (meaningful directions in the latent space
of a model) instead of model components.

Just as the entire model M deﬁnes a function M(x) from inputs to logits, we also associate each
circuit C with a function C(x) via knockouts. A knockout removes a set of nodes K in a compu-
tational graph M with the goal of “turning off” nodes in K but capturing all other computations in
M. Thus, C(x) is deﬁned by knocking out all nodes in M\C and taking the resulting logit outputs
in the modiﬁed computational graph.

A ﬁrst na¨ıve knockout approach consists of simply deleting each node in K from M. The net effect
of this removal is to zero ablate K, meaning that we set its output to 0. This na¨ıve approach has
an important limitation: 0 is an arbitrary value, and subsequent nodes might rely on the average
activation value as an implicit bias term. Perhaps because of this, we ﬁnd zero ablation to lead to
noisy results in practice.

To address this, we instead knockout nodes through mean ablation: replacing them with their aver-
age activation value across some reference distribution, similar to the bias correction method used


                                       3

in Nanda & Lieberum (2022). Mean-ablations remove the information that varies in the reference
distribution (e.g. the value of the name outputted by a head) but will preserve constant information
(e.g. the fact that a head is outputting a name).

In this work, all knockouts are performed in a modiﬁed pIOI distribution called pABC. It relies on the
same generation procedure, but instead of using two names (IO and S) it used three unrelated random
names (A, B and C). In pABC, sentences no longer have a single plausible IO, but the grammatical
structures from the pIOI templates are preserved.

We chose this distribution for mean-ablating because using pIOI would not remove enough informa-
tion helpful for the task. For instance, some information constant in pIOI (e.g. the fact that a name
is duplicated) is removed when computing the mean on pABC.

When knocking out a single node, a (head, token position) pair in our circuit, we want to preserve
the grammatical information unrelated to IOI contained in its activations. However, the grammatical
role (subject, verb, conjunction etc.) of a particular token position varies across templates. To ensure
that grammatical information is constant when averaging, we compute the mean of a node across
samples of the same template.


3  DISCOVERING THE CIRCUIT


We seek to explain how GPT-2 small implements the IOI task (Section 2).  Recall the example
sentence “When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to”. The following human-
interpretable algorithm sufﬁces to perform this task:

1. Identify all previous names in the sentence (Mary, John, John).
2. Remove all names that are duplicated (in the example above: John).
3. Output the remaining name.

Below we present a circuit that we claim implements this functionality. Our circuit contains three
major classes of heads, corresponding to the three steps of the algorithm above:

• Duplicate Token Heads identify tokens that have already appeared in the sentence. They are active
   at the S2 token, attend primarily to the S1 token, and signal that token duplication has occurred
  by writing the position of the duplicate token.
• S-Inhibition Heads remove duplicate tokens from Name Mover Heads’ attention. They are active
   at the END token, attend to the S2 token, and write in the query of the Name Mover Heads,
   inhibiting their attention to S1 and S2 tokens.
• Name Mover Heads output the remaining name. They are active at END, attend to previous names
   in the sentence, and copy the names they attend to. Due to the S-Inhibition Heads, they attend to
  the IO token over the S1 and S2 tokens.

Figure 2: We discover a circuit in GPT-2 small that implements IOI. The input tokens on the left are
passed into the residual stream. Attention heads move information between residual streams: the
query and output arrows show which residual streams they write to, and the key/value arrows show
which residual streams they read from.


                                       4

A fourth major family of heads writes in the opposite direction of the Name Mover Heads, thus
decreasing the conﬁdence of the predictions. We speculate that these Negative Name Mover Heads
might help the model “hedge” so as to avoid high cross-entropy loss when making mistakes.

There are also three minor classes of heads that perform related functions to the components above:

• Previous Token Heads copy information about the token S to token S1+1, the token after S1.
• Induction Heads perform the same role as the Duplicate Token Heads through an induction mech-
  anism. They are active at position S2, attend to token S1+1 (mediated by the Previous Token
  Heads), and their output is used both as a pointer to S1 and as a signal that S is duplicated.
• Finally, Backup Name Mover Heads do not normally move the IO token to the output, but take on
   this role if the regular Name Mover Heads are knocked out.

In all of our experiments, we do not intervene on MLPs, layer norms, or embedding matrices,
focusing our investigation on understanding the attention heads. In initial investigations, we found
that knocking out each MLP individually led to good task performance, except for the ﬁrst layer.
However, knocking out all MLPs after the ﬁrst layer makes the model unable to perform the task
(Appendix J). A more precise investigation of the role of MLPs is left for future work.

Below we show how we discovered each of the seven components above, providing evidence that
they behave as claimed. We found that it was easiest to uncover the circuit starting at the logits and
working back step-by-step. Each step is divided into two parts. First, we trace the information ﬂow
backward from previously discovered components by ﬁnding attention heads that directly inﬂuence
them; we do this using a technique we introduce called path patching, which generalizes the ap-
plication of causal mediation analysis to language models introduced in Vig et al. (2020). Second,
we characterize the newly identiﬁed heads by examining their attention patterns and performing
experiments tailored to their hypothesized function.


3.1  WHICH HEADS DIRECTLY AFFECT THE OUTPUT? (NAME MOVER HEADS)

Tracing back the information ﬂow. We begin by searching for attention heads h directly affecting
the model’s logits. To differentiate indirect effect (where the inﬂuence of a component is mediated
by another head) from direct effect, we designed a technique called path patching (Figure 1).

Path patching replaces part of a model’s forward pass with activations from a different input. Given
inputs xorig and xnew, and a set of paths P emanating from a node h, path patching runs a forward
pass on xorig, but for the paths in P it replaces the activations for h with those from xnew. In our
case, h will be a ﬁxed attention head and P consists of all direct paths from h to a set of components
R, i.e. paths through residual connections and MLPs (but not through other attention heads); this
measures the counterfactual effect of h on the members of R. The layers after the element from R
are recomputed as in a normal forward pass. See Appendix B for full details of the method.

We will always take xorig to be a sample from pIOI, and xnew the corresponding sample from pABC
(i.e. where the names in the sentence are replaced by three random names). We run path patching on
many random samples from pIOI and measure how this affects the average logit difference. Pathways
h →R that are critical to the model’s computation should induce a large drop in logit difference
when patched, since the pABC distribution removes the information needed to complete the IOI task.

To trace information back from the logits, we run path patching for the pathway h →Logits for
each head h at the END position and display the effect on logit difference in Figure 3a. We see that
only a few heads in the ﬁnal layers cause a large effect on logit difference. Speciﬁcally, patching
9.6, 9.9, and 10.0 causes a large drop (they thus contribute positively to the logit difference), while
10.7 and 11.10 cause a large increase (they contribute negatively to the logit difference).

Name Mover Heads. To understand the heads positively inﬂuencing the logit difference, we ﬁrst
study their attention patterns. We ﬁnd that they attend strongly to the IO token: the average attention
probability of all heads over pIOI is 0.59. We hypothesize that these heads (i) attend to the correct
name and (ii) copy whatever they attend to. We therefore call these heads Name Mover Heads.

To verify our hypothesis, we design experiments to test the heads’ functionality. Let WU denote
the unembedding matrix, and WU[IO], WU[S] the corresponding unembedding vectors for the IO
and S tokens. We scatter plot the attention probability against the logit score ⟨hi(X), WU[N]⟩,
measuring how much head hi on input X is writing in the direction of the logit of the name N

(IO or S). The results are shown in Figure 3c: higher attention probability on the IO or S token is
correlated with higher output in the direction of the name (correlation ρ > 0.81, N = 500)1.

To check that the Name Mover Heads copy names generally, we studied what values are written
via the heads’ OV matrix.  Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst obtained the state of the residual stream at the
position of each name token after the ﬁrst MLP layer. Then, we multiplied this by the OV matrix of
a Name Mover Head (simulating what would happen if the head attended perfectly to that token),
multiplied by the unembedding matrix, and applied the ﬁnal layer norm to obtain logit probabilities.
We compute the proportion of samples that contain the input name token in the top 5 logits (N =
1000) and call this the copy score. All three Name Mover Heads have a copy score above 95%,
compared to less than 20% for an average head.

Negative Name Mover Heads. In Figure 3b, we also observed two heads causing a large increase,
and thus negatively inﬂuencing the logit difference. We called these heads Negative Name Mover
Heads. These share all the same properties as Name Mover Heads except they (1) write in the
opposite direction of names they attend to and (2) have a large negative copy score–the copy score
calculated with the negative of the OV matrix (98% compared to 12% for an average head).


3.2  WHICH HEADS AFFECT THE NAME MOVER HEADS’ ATTENTION? (S-INHIBITION
    HEADS)

Tracing back the information ﬂow. Given that the Name Mover Heads are primarily responsible
for constructing the output, we next ask what heads they depend on. As illustrated in Figure 4a,
there are three ways to inﬂuence attention heads: by their values, keys, or queries. In the case of
Name Mover Heads, their value matrix appears to copy the input tokens (see previous section), so
we do not study it further. Moreover, as the IO token appears early in the context, the Name Mover
Heads’ key vectors for this position likely do not contain much task-speciﬁc information. Therefore,
we focus on the query vector, which is located at the END position.

We again use path patching, identifying the heads that affect each Name Mover Head’s query vector.
Speciﬁcally, for a head h we patch the path h →Name Mover Heads’ queries (Figure 4a) and report

   1In GPT-2 small, there is a layer norm before the ﬁnal unembedding matrix. This means that these dot
products computed are not appropriately scaled. However, empirically we found that approaches to approxi-
mating the composition of attention head outputs with this layer norm were complicated, and resulted in similar
correlation and scatter plots.

the effect on logit difference in Figure 4b. Heads 7.3, 7.9, 8.6, 8.10 directly inﬂuence the Name
Mover Heads’ queries, causing a signiﬁcant drop in logit difference through this path.

S-Inhibition Heads. To better understand the inﬂuence of these heads on the Name Movers Heads,
we visualized Name Movers Heads’ attention before and after applying path patching of all four
previously identiﬁed heads at once (Figure 4c). Patching these heads leads to a greater probability
on S1 (and thus less on IO). We therefore call these heads S-Inhibition Heads, since their effect is to
decrease attention to S1.

What are S-Inhibition heads writing? We observed that S-Inhibition heads preferentially attend to
the S2 token (the average attention from END to S2 was 0.51 over the four heads). We conjectured
that they move information about S that causes Name Movers to attend less to S1. We discovered
two signals through which S-Inhibition Heads do this. The ﬁrst, the token signal, contains the value
of the token S and causes Name Mover Heads to avoid occurrences of that token. The second, the
position signal, contains information about the position of the S1 token, causing Name Mover Heads
to avoid the S1 position no matter the value of the token at this position.

To disentangle the two effects, we designed a series of counterfactual experiments where only some
signals are present, and the others are inverted with respect to the original dataset (see Appendix A).
Both effects matter, but position signals have a greater effect than token signals. These two signals
sufﬁce to account for the full average difference in Name Mover Heads’ attention to IO over S1.


                                       7

S-Inhibition heads output information about the position of S1 but don’t attend to it directly. They
thus must rely on the output of other heads through value composition, as we will see next.


3.3  WHICH HEADS AFFECT S-INHIBITION VALUES?

Tracing back the information ﬂow. We next trace the information ﬂow back through the queries,
keys, and values of the S-Inhibition Heads, using path patching as before. We found the values were
the most important and so focus on them here, with keys discussed in Appendix C (queries had no
signiﬁcant direct effect on the S-Inhibition Heads).

In more  detail,  for  each  head h  at  the S2  position we  patched  in  the  path h →
S-Inhibition Heads’s values (Figure 5a) and reported results in Figure 5b.

We identiﬁed 4 heads with a signiﬁcant negative effect on logit difference. By looking at their
attention pattern, we separated them into two groups. The heads from the ﬁrst group attend from S2
to S1, while those from the second group attend from S2 to the token after S1 (S1+1 in short).

Duplicate Token Heads. Two of the heads attend from S2 to S1. We hypothesize that these heads
attend to the previous occurrence of a duplicate token and copy the position of this previous occur-
rence to the current position. We therefore call them Duplicate Token Heads.

To partially validate this hypothesis, we investigated these heads’ attention patterns on sequences of
random tokens (with no semantic meaning). We found that the 2 Duplicate Token Heads pay strong
attention to a previous occurrence of the current token when it exists (see Appendix I).

Induction Heads and Previous Token Heads. The other group of two heads attends from S2 to
S1+1. This matches the attention pattern of Induction Heads (Elhage et al., 2021), which recognize
the general pattern [A] [B] ... [A] and contribute to predicting [B] as the next token. For this,
they act in pairs with Previous Token Heads. The Previous Token Heads write information about
[A] into the residual stream at [B]. Induction Heads can then match the next occurrence of [A] to
that position (and subsequently copy [B] to the output).

To test the hypothesis that this group of heads consists of Induction Heads, we sought out the Pre-
vious Token Heads that they rely on through key composition. To this end, we apply path patching
to ﬁnd heads that inﬂuence logit difference through the S1+1 keys of the Induction Heads (see Ap-
pendix D). We identiﬁed two heads with signiﬁcant effect sizes. To test the induction mechanism,
we followed the method introduced in Olsson et al. (2022) by checking for preﬁx-matching (attend-
ing to [B] on pattern like [A] [B] ... [A]) and copying (increasing the logit of the [B] token)
of Induction Heads on repeated random sequences of tokens. We also analyzed the attention patterns
of Previous Token Heads on the same dataset. As reported in Appendix H, Previous Token Heads
attend primarily to the previous token and 2 Induction Heads demonstrate both preﬁx-matching and
copying.

Locating the position signal. Despite their differences, the attention patterns of both groups of
heads are determined by the position of S1, suggesting that their output could also contain this
information. We thus hypothesized that Duplicate Token Heads and Induction Heads are the origin
of the position signal described in Section 3.2, which is then copied by S-Inhibition Heads.

To test this hypothesis, we applied the same technique from the previous section to isolate token and
position signals. We patched the output of the Induction and Duplicate Token Heads from sentences
with altered position signals. We observed a drop in logit difference of almost the same size as
patching the S-Inhibition Heads (at least 88%). However, patching their output from a dataset with
a different S1 and S2 token but at the same position doesn’t change the logit difference (less than
8% of the drop induced by patching S-Inhibition Heads).

Missing validations and caveats. To fully validate the claimed function of the Duplicate Token
and Induction Heads, we would want to perform additional checks that we omitted due to time
constraints.  First, for Duplicate Token Heads, we would want to study the interaction of the QK
matrix with the token embeddings to test if it acts as a collision detector. Moreover, we would
investigate the OV matrix to ensure it is copying information from positional embeddings.  For
Induction Heads, we would perform the more thorough parameter analysis in Elhage et al. (2021) to
validate the copying and key composition properties at the parameter level.


                                       8

Moreover, in the context we study, Induction Heads perform a different function compared to what
was described in their original discovery. In our circuit, Induction Heads’ outputs are used as posi-
tional signals for S-Inhibition values. We did not investigate how this mechanism was implemented.
More work is needed to precisely characterize these newly discovered heads and understand how
they differ from the original description of Induction Heads.


3.4  DID WE MISS ANYTHING? THE STORY OF THE BACKUP NAME MOVERS HEADS

Each type of head in our circuit has many copies, suggesting that the model implements redundant
behavior2. To make sure that we didn’t miss any copies, we knocked out all the Name Mover
Heads at once. To our surprise, the circuit still worked (only 5% drop in logit difference). After
the knockout, we found the new heads directly affecting the logits using the same path patching
experiment from Section 3.1. These new heads compensate for the loss of Name Movers Heads by
replacing their role.

We selected the eight heads with the highest direct inﬂuence on logit difference after knockout and
call them Backup Name Mover Heads. We investigated their behavior before the knockout. We
observe diverse behavior: 4 heads show a close resemblance to Name Mover Heads, 2 heads equally
attend to IO and S and copy them, 1 head pays more attention to S1 and copies it, and 1 head seems
to track and copy subjects of clauses, copying S2 in this case. See Appendix F for further details on
these heads.

We hypothesize that this compensation phenomenon is caused by the use of dropout during training.
Thus, the model was optimized for robustness to dysfunctional parts. More work is needed to
determine the origin of this phenomenon and if such compensation effects can be observed beyond
our special case.


4  EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

In the previous section, we provided an end-to-end explanation of how the model produces a high
logit difference between IO and S on the IOI task. Yet Section 3.4 shows that our experimental
methods do not fully account for all name-moving in the model: some new heads take on this role
after the main Name Mover Heads are knocked out. We therefore seek more systematic validations
to check that our account in Section 2.1 includes all components used by the model to perform IOI.

To formalize this, we ﬁrst introduce notation to measure the performance of a circuit C on the IOI
task. Suppose X ∼pIOI, and f(C(X); X) is the logit difference between the IO and S tokens when
the circuit C is run on the input X (recall that C(X) is deﬁned by knocking out all nodes outside C,
                                                                                                  def
as described in Section 2.1). We deﬁne the average logit difference F(C) = EX∼pIOI [f(C(X); X)]
as a measure of how well C performs the IOI task.

Using F, we introduce three criteria for validating a circuit C. The ﬁrst one, faithfulness, asks that
C has similar performance to the full model M, as measured by |F(M) −F(C)|. For the circuit C
from Figure 2, we ﬁnd that |F(M) −F(C)| = 0.46, or only 13% of F(M) = 3.56. In other words,
C achieves 87% of the performance of M.

However, as the Backup Name Mover Heads illustrate, faithfulness alone is not enough to ensure a
complete account. In Section 4.1 we introduce a toy example that illustrates this issue in more detail
and use this to deﬁne two other criteria—completeness and minimality—for checking our circuit.


4.1  COMPLETENESS

As a running example, suppose a model M uses two identical and disjoint serial circuits C1 and C2.
The two sub-circuits are run in parallel before applying an OR operation to their results. Identifying
only one of the circuits is enough to achieve faithfulness, but we want explanations that include both
C1 and C2, since these are both used in the model’s computation.

    2It is unlikely that SGD would select for perfectly redundant modules, but redundancy is more likely when
analyzing a sub-distribution of all of a model’s training data or a subtask of its behavior.

Figure 6: Plot of points (xK, yK) = (F(C \ K), F(M \ K)) for (a) our circuit and (b) a naive
circuit. Each point is for a different choice of K. We show sets K obtained from different sampling
strategies: 10 uniformly randomly chosen K ⊆C, K = ∅, K a class of heads from the circuit, and
10 K found by greedy optimization. Since the incompleteness score is |xK −yK|, we show the line
y = x for reference.

To solve this problem, we introduce the completeness criterion:  for every subset K ⊆C, the
incompleteness score |F(C \ K) −F(M \ K)| should be small. In other words, C and M should
not just be similar, but remain similar under knockouts.

In our running example, we can show that C1 is not complete by setting K = C1. Then C1 \ K is
the empty circuit while M \ K still contains C2. The metric |F(C1 \ K) −F(M \ K)| will be large
because C1 \ K has trivial performance while M \ K successfully performs the task.

Testing completeness requires a search over exponentially many subsets K ⊆C. This is computa-
tionally intractable given the size of our circuit, hence we use three sampling methods to seek sets
K that give large incompleteness scores:

• The ﬁrst sampling method chooses subsets K ⊆C uniformly at random.
• The second sampling method set K to be an entire class of circuit heads G, e.g the Name Mover
  Heads. C \ G should have low performance since it’s missing a key component, whereas M \ G
  might still do well if it has redundant components that ﬁll in for G.
• Thirdly, we greedily optimized K node-by-node to maximize the incompleteness score (see Ap-
  pendix M for details).

All results are shown in Figure 6a. The ﬁrst two methods of sampling K suggested to us that
our circuit was complete, as every incompleteness score computed with those methods was small.
However, the third resulted in sets K that had high incompleteness score: up to 3.09 (87% of the
original logit difference). These greedily-found sets were usually not semantically interpretable
(containing heads from multiple categories), and investigating them would be an interesting direction
of future work.


4.2  MINIMALITY

A faithful and complete circuit may contain unnecessary components, and so be overly complex. To
avoid this, we should check that each of its nodes v is actually necessary. This can be evaluated by
showing that v can signiﬁcantly recover F after knocking out a set of nodes K.

Formally, the minimality criterion is whether for every node v ∈C there exists a subset K ⊆
C \ {v} that has high minimality score |F(C \ (K ∪{v})) −F(C \ K)|.

In the running example, we can show that C1∪C2 is minimal. The proof has two symmetrical cases:
v ∈C1 and v ∈C2. Without loss of generality, we chose v ∈C1, and then deﬁne K = C2. The
minimality score for this choice of node v and set K is equal to |F(C1 \ {v}) −F(C1)|, which is
large since C1 is a serial circuit and so removing v will destroy the behavior.

What happens in practice for our circuit? We need to exhibit for every v a set K such that the
minimality score is high. For most heads, removing the class of heads G that v is a part of provides

a reasonable minimality score, but in some instances a more careful choice is needed; we provide
full details in Appendix K and display ﬁnal results in Figure 7. The importance of different nodes
varies, but all have a nontrivial impact (at least 1% of the original logit difference). These results
ensure that we did not interpret irrelevant nodes, but do show that the individual contribution of
some attention heads is small.


4.3  COMPARISON WITH A BASELINE CIRCUIT

In the previous sections, we evaluated our circuit on three quantitative criteria. To establish a base-
line for these criteria, we compare to a na¨ıve circuit that consists of the Name Mover Heads (but no
Backup nor Negative Name Mover Heads), S-Inhibition Heads, two Induction Heads, two Duplicate
Token Heads, and the Previous Token Heads. This circuit has a faithfulness score of 0.1, comparable
to the full circuit C. However, the na¨ıve circuit can be more easily proven incomplete: by sampling
random sets or by knocking-out by classes, we see that F(M \ K) is much higher than F(C \ K)
(Figure 6a). Nonetheless, when we applied the greedy heuristic to optimize for the incompleteness
score, both circuits have similarly large incompleteness scores.


4.4  DESIGNING ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES

As argued in R¨auker et al. (2022), one way to evaluate the knowledge gained by interpretability
work is to use it for downstream applications. In this section, we do this by using knowledge of the
circuit to construct simple adversarial examples for the model.

As presented in Section 3, the model relies on duplicate detection to differentiate between S and
IO. Motivated by this, we constructed passages where both the S and IO tokens are duplicated. An
example is “John and Mary went to the store. Mary had a good day. John gave a bottle of milk to”;
see Appendix L for full details. We ﬁnd that this signiﬁcantly reduces the logit difference and causes
the model to predict S over IO 23% of the time (Figure 8).

To ensure that the observed effect is not an artifact of the additional sentences, we included a control
dataset using the same templates, but where the middle sentence contains S instead of IO. In these
sentences, S appears three times in total and IO only appears once. On this distribution, the model
has an even higher logit difference than on pIOI, and predicts S over IO only 0.4% of the time.

Limitations of the attack. Despite being inspired by our understanding of our circuit, those exam-
ples are simple enough that they could have been found without our circuit with enough effort.

Moreover, we do not have a full understanding of the mechanisms at play in these adversarial exam-
ples. For instance, the S-Inhibition Heads attend not only to S2, but also to the second occurrence of
IO. As this pattern is not present in pIOI nor in pABC, it is beyond the analysis presented in Section
3. The study of the behavior of the circuit on these adversarial examples could be a promising area
for future work.


5  DISCUSSION

In this work, we isolated, understood and validated a set of attention heads in GPT-2 small composed
in a circuit that identiﬁes indirect objects. Along the way, we discovered interesting structures
emerging from the model internals. For instance:

• We identiﬁed an example of attention heads communicating by using pointers (sharing the loca-
   tion of a piece of information instead of copying it).

• We identiﬁed heads compensating for the loss of function of other heads, and heads contributing
  negatively to the next-token prediction. Early results suggest that the latter phenomenon occurs
   for other tasks beyond IOI (see Appendix H).

However, our work also has several limitations. First, despite the detailed analysis presented here,
we do not understand several components. Those include the attention patterns of the S-Inhibition
Heads, and the effect of MLPs and layer norms. Second, the number of parameters in GPT-2 small
is orders of magnitude away from state-of-the-art transformer language models. A future challenge
is to scale this approach to these larger models.

As a starting point, we performed a preliminary analysis of GPT-2 medium. We found that this
model also has a sparse set of heads directly inﬂuencing the logits. However, not all of these heads
attend to IO and S, suggesting more complex behavior than the Name Movers Heads in GPT-2 small.
Continuing this investigation is an exciting line of future work.

More generally, we think that zooming in on a clearly deﬁned task in a single model enables a rich
description of phenomena that are likely to be found in broader circumstances. In the same way
model organisms in biology enable discoveries valuable beyond a speciﬁc species, we think these
highly detailed (though narrow) examples are crucial to developing a comprehensive understanding
of machine learning models.

6  APPENDIX

A  DISENTANGLING TOKEN AND POSITIONAL SIGNAL IN THE OUTPUT OF
    S-INHIBITION HEADS

In Section 3.2, we discovered that S-Inhibition Heads are responsible for the Name Mover Heads’
speciﬁc attention on the IO token, and in particular we discovered that their output is a signal for
Name Movers Heads to avoid the S1 token.

More precisely, we discover that they were outputting token signals (information about the value of
the token S) and positional signals (related to the value of the position S1). We describe here the
details of this discovery.

To disentangle the two effects, we design a series of counterfactual datasets where only some signals
are present, and some are inverted with respect to the original dataset. In this section, we conducted
activation patching (or simply patching). Instead of patching isolated paths, we patch the output of
a set of heads and recompute the forward pass of the model after this modiﬁcation. As shown in
Section 3.4, the output of later (Backup) Name Mover Heads and Negative Heads depend on earlier
heads from these classes, such that it is not possible to ignore the interactions between heads inside
a class (as it is the case in path patching in Appendix B).

By patching the output of S-Inhibition heads from these datasets, we can quantify in isolation the
impact of each signal on the ﬁnal logit difference.

We constructed six datasets by combining three transformations of the original pIOI distribution.

• Random name ﬂip: we replace the names from a given sentence with random names, but we keep
  the same position for all names. Moreover, each occurrence of a name in the original sentence
   is replaced by the same random name. When we patch outputs of S-Inhibition heads from this

  sentence, only positional signals are present, the token signals are unrelated to the names of the
   original sequence.
• IO↔S1 ﬂip: we swap the position of IO and S1. The output of S-inhibition heads will contain
   correct token signals (the subject of the second clause is the same) but inverted positional signals
  (because the position of IO and S1 are swapped)
• IO←S2 replacement: we make IO become the subject of the sentence and S the indirect object.
  In this dataset, both token signals and positional signals are inverted.

We can also compose these transformations. For instance, we can create a dataset with no token
signals and inverted positional signals by applying IO↔S1 ﬂip on the dataset with random names.
In total, we can create all six combinations of original, inverted, or uncorrelated token signal with
the original and inverted positional signal.

From each of those six datasets, we patched the output of S-Inhibition heads and measured the logit
difference. The results are presented in Figure 9.

These results can be summarized as the sum of the two effects. Suppose we deﬁne the variable Stok
to be 1 if the token signal is the original, 0 when uncorrelated and -1 when inverted. And similarly
Spos to be 1 if the position signal is the original and -1 if inverted. Then the Figure 9 suggests that
the logit difference can be well approximated by 2.31Spos + 0.99Stok, with a mean error of 7%
relative to the baseline logit difference.

For instance, when both the positional and token signals are inverted, the logit difference is the
opposite of the baseline. This means that the S token is predicted stronger than the IO token, as
strong as IO before patching. In this situation, due to the contradictory information contained in
the output of S-Inhibition heads, the Name Movers attend and copy the S1 token instead of the IO
token (see Figure 10, right). In the intermediate cases where only one of the signals is modiﬁed,
we observe a partial effect compared to the fully inverted case (e.g. Figure 10, left). The effect size
depends on the altered signals: positional signals are more important than token signals.

Can we be more speciﬁc as to what the token and positional signals are? Unfortunately, we do not
have a complete answer, but see this as one of the most interesting further directions of our work.
We expect that the majority of the positional information is about the relative positional embedding

between S1 and S2 (such pointer arithmetic behavior has already been observed in Olsson et al.
(2022)). When patching in S2 Inhibition outputs from a distribution where preﬁxes to sentences are
longer (but the distance between S1 and S2 is constant), the logit difference doesn’t change (3.56
before patching vs 3.57 after). This suggests that the positional signal doesn’t depend on the absolute
position of the tokens, as long as the relative position of S1 and S2 stays the same.


B  PATH PATCHING

In this section we describe the technical details of the path patching technique we used in many
experiments. This technique depends on

• xorig the original data point,
• xnew the new data point,
• h the sender attention head, and

• R ⊆M the set of receiver nodes in the model’s computational graph M. In our case, R is either
  the input (key, query or values) of a set of attention heads or the end state of the residual stream3.

It is then implemented as Algorithm 1, which can be summarized in ﬁve steps.

1. Gather activations on xorig and xnew. [Lines 1-2, Figure 11A-B]
2. Freeze4 all the heads to their activation on xorig except h that is patched to its activation on xnew.
  [Lines 4-5, Figure 11C]
3. Run a forward pass of the model on xorig with the frozen and patched nodes (MLPs and layer
  norm are recomputed). [Line 7, Figure 11C]

4. In this forward pass, save the activation of the model components r ∈R as if they were recom-
  puted (but this value is overwritten in the forward pass because they are frozen). [Line 6-9, Figure
  11C]

   3The model uses the end state of the residual stream to compute the logits (after a layer norm), so we choose
R equal to this end state when we wish to measure the direct effect of h on the logits.
  4We use ‘freezing’ of an activation a to refer to the special case of patching when we begin a forward pass
on an input x, edit some earlier activations, and then want to patch a to its value on a forward pass of x (which
did not have the edits of earlier activations).


                                       16

5. Run a last forward pass on xorig patching the receiver nodes in R to the saved values. [Lines
  12-20, Figure 11D]

Each of the A variables in Algorithm 1 (Aorig, Anew and Apatch) stores activations for all nodes in
M. Aorig and Anew contain output activations while Apatch contains the activation of the nodes in
R (keys, queries or values of attention heads, or the end state of the residual stream).

In forward pass C of the algorithm all attention heads except h have their output frozen to their value
on xorig. This means that we remove the inﬂuence of every path including one (or more) intermediate
attention heads p of the form h →p →r, where r ∈R. In all cases in the paper, we measure the
logit difference on the forward pass D compared to the logit difference of the model, as a measure
of the importance of the path h →r. We additionally compute this logit difference as an average
over N > 200 pairs (xorig, xnew).

 2: Compute all activations Aorig on xorig (forward pass B)
 3: for r ∈R do
 4:    Arpatch ←Aorig
 5:    Arpatch[h] ←Arnew[h]
 6:     for each MLP m between h and r do
 7:       Recompute Arpatch[m] from the activations in Arpatch (forward pass C)
 8:    end for
 9:    Recompute Arpatch[r] from the activations in Arpatch (forward pass C)

16:     else

C  DIRECT EFFECT ON S-INHIBITION HEADS’ KEYS

In this section, we present the direct effect analysis of the S-Inhibition Heads’ keys. The experiment
is similar to the investigation of the S-Inhibition Heads’ values presented in Section 3.2.

The results presented in Figure 12b show that some heads signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the logit difference
through S-Inhibition Heads’ keys. We observe that Duplicate Token Heads (3.0 and 0.1) appear to
also inﬂuence S-Inhibition Heads’ values, but their effect is reversed.

Moreover, we identify 3 new heads inﬂuencing positively the logit difference: 5.9, 5.8 and 0.10.

Fuzzy Duplicate Token Head By looking at its attention pattern, we identiﬁed that 0.10 was paying
attention to S1 from S2. However, the attention pattern was fuzzy, as intermediate tokens also have
non-negligible attention probability. We thus call it a fuzzy Duplicate Token Head. On Open Web
Text (OWT), the fuzzy Duplicate Token Head attend to duplicates in a short range (see Appendix I).

Fuzzy Induction Heads The heads 5.9, 5.8 are paying attention to S1+1. For 5.8, S1+1 is the token
with the highest attention probability after the start token. But the absolute value is small (less than
0.1). The head 5.9 is paying attention to S1+1 but also to tokens before S. Because of these less
interpretable attention patterns, we called them fuzzy Induction Heads. (see Appendix H for more
details about their behavior outside IOI).

By inﬂuencing the keys of the S-Inhibition Heads, we hypothesize that those heads are amplifying
the positional signal written by the other Induction and Duplicate Token Heads.

D  IDENTIFICATION OF PREVIOUS TOKEN HEADS



Induction Heads rely on key composition with Previous Token Heads to recognize patterns of the
form [A] [B] ... [A]. In the context of IOI, the repeated token [A] is S2. We thus searched for
heads directly affecting Induction Heads keys at the S1+1 position (the [B] token in the general
pattern). For this, we used path patching. The results of the experiment are visible in Figure 13.
We identify two main heads causing a decrease in logit difference (and thus contributing positively
to the logit difference): 4.11 and 2.2. These heads pay primary attention to the previous token.
This is coherent with the Previous Token Heads we were expecting. We thoroughly investigate their
attention patterns outside of pIOI in Appendix H.

Olsson et al. (2022) also describes an induction mechanism relying on query composition in GPT-2.
We performed path patching to investigate heads inﬂuencing the Induction Heads queries at the S2
position, but did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect.



E  IOI TEMPLATES



We list all the templates we used in Figure 14. Each name was drawn from a list of 100 English ﬁrst
names, while the place and the object were chosen among a hand-made list of 20 common words.
All the words chosen were one token long to ensure proper sequence alignment computation of the
mean activations.

we use templates that ﬁt the ‘ABBA’ pattern as well (i.e, by swapping the ﬁrst instances of [B] and
[A] in all of the above).


F  BACKUP NAME MOVER HEADS


Here we discuss in more detail the discovery of the Backup Name Mover Heads. As shown in Figure
15, knocking-out the three main Name Mover Heads surprisingly changes the behavior of the other
heads that write in the IO-S direction (both positively and negatively). These heads compensate for
the loss of function from the Name Mover Heads such that the logit difference is only 5% lower.
We observe that the Negative Name Mover Heads have a less negative effect on logit difference,
and 10.7 even has a positive effect on the logit difference after the knockout. The other heads that
affected slightly positively the logit difference before the knock-out become the main contributors.
Both the reason and the mechanism of this compensation effect are still unclear. We think that this
could be an interesting phenomenon to investigate in future works.

Among the heads inﬂuencing positively the logit difference after knockout, we identiﬁed S-
Inhibition Heads and a set of other heads that we called Backup Name Mover Heads. We arbitrarily
chose to keep the eight heads that were not part of any other groups, and affected the logit difference
with an effect size above the threshold of 2%.

In Figure 16 we analyze the behavior of those newly identiﬁed heads with similar techniques as
Name Mover Heads. Those can be grouped in 4 categories.


• Four heads (9.0, 10.1, 10.10 and 10.6) that behave similarly to Name Mover Heads in their
   attention patterns, and the scatter plots of attention vs.   dot product of their output with
  WU[IO] −WU[S] (e.g 10.10 in Figure 16).

• Two heads (10.2, 11.9) that pay equal attention to S1 and IO and write both of them (e.g 10.2 in
  Figure 16).

• One head, 11.2, that pays more attention to S1 and writes preferentially in the direction of WU[S].

• One head, 9.7, pays attention to S2 and writes negatively.


We did not thoroughly investigate this diversity of behavior, more work can be done to precisely
describe these heads. However, these heads are also the ones with the less individual importance for
the task (as shown by their minimality score in Figure 7). The exact choice of Backup Name Mover
Heads doesn’t change signiﬁcantly the behavior of the circuit.

G  GPT-2 SMALL FULL ARCHITECTURE

Here we deﬁne all components of the GPT-2 architecture, including those we don’t use in the main
text. GPT-2 small has the following parameters

• N: number of input tokens.
• V : length of vocabulary of tokens.
• d: residual stream dimension.
• L: number of layers.
• H: number of heads per layer.
• D: hidden dimension of MLPs.

It uses layer norm, the non-linear function

                                                          def    x −¯x
                           LN(x) =                          ,                                  (1)
                  pPi(xi −¯xi)2

where the mean and the difference from the mean sum are over all components of the dimension
d vector in each sequence position. This is then followed by a learned linear transformation M
(different for each layer norm).

In GPT-2 the MLPs all have one hidden layer of dimension D and use the GeLU non-linearity. Their
input is the layer normed state of the residual stream.

We addressed the parametrisation of each attention head in the main text, and cover the technical
details of the WQK and WOV matrix here: the attention pattern is Ai,j = softmax(xT W QKx)i,j
                                                                                                                                  def
where the softmax is taken for each token position, and is unidirectional. We then have hi,j(x) =
M ◦LN((Ai,j ⊗W OVi,j ).x).
Algorithm 2 describe how these elements are combined in the forward pass of GPT-2 small.

H  VALIDATION OF THE INDUCTION MECHANISM ON SEQUENCES OF
   RANDOM TOKENS

We run GPT-2 small on sequences of 100 tokens sampled uniformly at random from GPT-2’s token
vocabulary. Each sequence A was duplicated to form AA, a sequence twice as long where the ﬁrst
and second half are identical. On this dataset, we computed two scores from the attention patterns
of the attention heads:

Figure 17: Contribution to the next token prediction per head on repeated sequences of tokens. The
heads are ordered by decreasing absolute values of contribution. Black contour: heads with attention
patterns demonstrating preﬁx matching property.


• The previous token score: we averaged the attention probability on the off-diagonal. This is the
  average attention from the token at position i to position i −1.

• The induction score: the average attention probability from Ti to the token that comes after the
   ﬁrst occurrence of Ti (i.e. Ti−99)

These two scores are depicted in Figure 18 (center and right) for all attention heads.

Previous Token Heads. 4.11 and 2.2 are the two heads with the highest previous token score on
sequences of random tokens. This is a strong validation of their role outside pIOI.

Induction Heads. Olsson et al. (2022) deﬁne an Induction Head according to its behavior on re-
peated sequences of random tokens. The attention head must demonstrate two properties. i) Preﬁx-
matching property. The head attends to [B] from the last [A] on pattern like [A] [B] ... [A] ii)
Copy property. The head contribute positively to the logit of [B] on the pattern [A][B]...[A].

5.5 and 6.9 are among the 5 heads with the highest induction score. This validates their preﬁx-
matching property introduced in Olsson et al. (2022).

To check their copy property, we computed the dot product ⟨hi(X), WU[B]⟩between the output of
the head hi on sequence X and the embedding of the token [B] on repeated sequences of random
tokens. The results are shown in Figure 17. The two Induction Heads (5.5 and 6.9) appear in the 20
heads contributing the most to the next token prediction. Thus validating their copying property.

We also noticed that the majority of the Negative, Backup and regular Name Mover Heads appear
to write in the next token direction on repeated sequences of random tokens, and Negative Name
Movers Heads contribute negatively. This suggests that these heads are involved beyond the IOI task
to produce next-token prediction relying on contextual information.


I  VALIDATION OF DUPLICATE TOKEN HEADS


On the repeated sequences of random tokens (Appendix H) we also computed the duplicate score.
For each token Ti in the second half of a sequence, we average the attention probability from Ti to
its previous occurrence in the ﬁrst half of the sequence (i.e. Ti−100).

The duplicate token scores for all attention heads are depicted in Figure 18. 3.0 and 0.1 are among
the three heads with the highest duplicate token score (Figure 18). This is evidence of their role of
Duplicate Token Heads outside the circuit for the IOI task.

erage attention probability from a token to its previous occurrence. Center: Previous token attention
score, it is the average of the off-diagonal attention probability. Right: Induction score. Average
attention probability from the second occurrence of [A] to [B] on patterns [A][B]...[A].


However, the fuzzy Duplicate Head 0.10 doesn’t appear on this test. By qualitatively investigating
its attention patterns on Open Web Text, we found that this head attends strongly to the current token.
Moreover, when the current token is a name, and it is duplicated, the head attends to its previous
occurrence.


J  ROLE OF MLPS IN THE TASK


In the main text, all of the circuit components are attention heads. Attention heads are the only
modules in transformers that move information across token positions – a crucial component of the
IOI task – so they were our main subject of interest. However, MLPs can still play a signiﬁcant role
in transforming the information in each residual stream. We explored this possibility by measuring
the direct and indirect effects of each of the MLPs in Figure 19. In these experiments, for each MLP
in turn, we did a path patching experiment (Section 3.2) to measure the direct effect and a knock-out
experiment for the indirect effect.

We observe that MLP0 has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on logit difference after knock-out (it reverses
the sign of the logit difference) but the other layers don’t seem to play a big role when individually
knocked out. When all MLP layers other than the ﬁrst layer are knocked out, however, the logit
difference becomes −1.1 (a similar effect to the knockout of MLP0 alone).

L  TEMPLATE FOR ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES

The design of adversarial examples relies on adding a duplicate IO to the sentences. To this end, we
used a modiﬁcation of the templates described in appendix E. We added an occurrence of [A] in the
form of a natural sentence, independent of the context. The list of sentence is visible in Figure 21.

                                  [A] had a good day.
                              [A] was enjoying the situation.
                                     [A] was tired.
                             [A] enjoyed being with a friend.
                              [A] was an enthusiast person.

sentences were chosen to be independent of the context.


M  GREEDY ALGORITHM

The Algorithm 3 describes the procedure used to sample sets for checking the completeness criteria
using greedy optimization. In practice, because the na¨ıve and the full circuit are not of the same size,
we chose respectively k = 5 and k = 10 to ensure a similar amount of stochasticity in the process.
We run the procedure 10 times and kept the 5 sets with the maximal important incompleteness score
(including the intermediate K).

Algorithm 3 The greedy sampling procedure for sets to validate the completeness citeria.

 1: K ←∅
 2: for i to N do
 3:    Sample a random subset V ⊆C \ K of k nodes uniformly.
 4:    vMAX ←arg maxv∈V |F(C \ (K ∪{v})) −F(C \ K)|
 5:  K ←K ∪{vMAX}
 6: end for
 7: return K

As visible in Figure 22 the sets found by the greedy search contain a combination of nodes from dif-
ferent classes. This means that it is difﬁcult to interpret how our circuit is incomplete, as mentioned
in the main text.
