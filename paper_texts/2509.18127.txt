D. Discussion

D.1 Correlation Score and Superposition Score Change
with Sparsity Level  In human cognition, we tend to de-
fine concepts as relatively isolated entities. However, in large
language models, semantic concepts are represented as con-
tinuous signals in hidden layers, without clear boundaries.
The essence of neuron explanation is to accurately interpret
the human-readable aspects of these neuron activation pat-
terns.
  Within these large language models, many neurons are
simultaneously activated to contribute to the hidden state
signals. Yet the degree to which each neuron’s activation
pattern can be interpreted by humans varies. Consequently,           Figure 13: Illustration of decoder weights W T W.

ternal decision-making process. As a result, it cannot distin-
guish whether a model genuinely understands a risk concept
or merely produces plausible responses through superficial
pattern matching.
  In our empirical investigation, we identify a more inter-
pretable alternative: analyzing activation patterns of neu-
rons extracted by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to capture
the model’s cognitive representations of risk. Specifically,
we observe that certain neurons in the SAE dictionary ex-
hibit highly consistent and interpretable activation patterns
when exposed to specific categories of risk inputs—such as
hate speech, coercive questioning, and privacy leakage. Cru-
cially, these activation patterns show strong correlations with
                                                                                                              (a) Chinese
the model’s final behavioral responses (e.g., refusal to an-
swer, content filtering, or safety warnings). Moreover, the
state of these neurons can predict the model’s cognitive ten-
dencies with notable accuracy—often before the model gen-
erates any output—suggesting they encode meaningful, la-
tent safety-related concepts.

E.2 Explanations of Selected Neurons  During the model
cognition detection process, the three neurons we observed
exhibit strong interpretative associations with pornographic
websites, with high correlation scores (over 0.4). Their spe-
cific interpretations are illustrated in Table 4. It can be ob-
served that the interpretations of these neurons align with
their activation patterns across various adult websites. Neu-
                                                                                                         (b) Italian

idating the effectiveness of the interpretations in our neuron
database.

E.3 Additional Results  To further validate the consis-
tency between neuron activation and the model’s cogni-
tive and behavioral patterns, we conducted the same ex-
periment on 20 fake pornographic websites and 20 ordi-
nary websites. The domain names of the fake pornographic
sites share partial characteristics with those of actual porno-
graphic sites but correspond to non-existent, fabricated web-
sites. The ordinary websites consist of commonly accessed,
benign sites. By comparing these results with the main ex-
periment presented in the paper, we confirm that neuron                                    (c) Vietnamese

  Neuron Index   Explanation
                 This neuron activates strongly on adult or sexually suggestive content, particularly detecting
                     explicit or sexually suggestive text across multiple languages (e.g., English, Chinese, Russian).
   26 18429
                         It shows robust responses to terms related to sexual content, adult websites, explicit descriptions,
                and pornographic categorization.
                 This neuron identifies patterns associated with Chinese adult content platforms and their techni-
                    cal signatures. Specifically, it responds to: 1. Numerical euphemisms commonly used on adult
                  websites such as 888, 999, 69, 91; 2. Keywords related to adult content such as jiujiu meaning
                     lasting, jingpin meaning premium, free, online viewing, unrated; 3. Website structural features
                 such as URL patterns like slash vod slash play slash 38806, dot com or dot html domain suf-
    17 1579
                      fixes, and video quality labels such as HD or high definition; 4. Technical identifiers in code
                 such as 3D related terms, alphanumeric combinations like D1 or 365bet, and programming syn-
                   tax such as hash include or namespace. The neuron is specifically tuned to adult platforms that
                 use combinations of Chinese characters and numerals to evade content filters, while also cap-
                   turing backend technical elements of streaming websites.
                 This neuron responds to explicit expressions related to sexual content, with a focus on adult en-
                   tertainment terminology in the Chinese context, such as ”adult”, ”Category III films”, ”pornog-
                  raphy”, ”AV”, and ”erotic content”, often combined with indicators of free access like ”free”
                and ”online viewing”. It shows strong activation to categories of adult content (e.g., ”domes-
    17 4828       tic” or ”Chinese-produced”, ”Western”), references to platforms (e.g., ”website”, ”.com”), and
                     explicit service descriptions (e.g., ”sex”, ”video”, and metaphorical expressions like ”big black
                     stick”). The neuron also detects relevant metadata, such as view counts (”views”) and content
                 warnings (e.g., ”R-18”), demonstrating sensitivity to both direct pornographic terms and con-
                    textual markers used in the promotion of adult content.

                                                         in diagnosing and understanding unintended model behav-

                                  We observed the same inference trajectory in the other three
                                                   languages(Figure 16). The fact that the model is able to gen-

                                                       safe response. Deviating from this path may lead to risky
