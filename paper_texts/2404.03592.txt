                1  Introduction

                       Pretrained language models (LMs) are frequently finetuned to adapt them to new domains or tasks
                      [Dai and Le, 2015]. With finetuning, a single base model can be adapted to a variety of tasks given
                     only small amounts of in-domain data. However, finetuning large LMs is expensive. Parameter-
                            efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods propose to address the high costs of full finetuning by updating a
                       small number of weights. This reduces memory usage and training time, and PEFTs achieve similararXiv:2404.03592v3               performance to full finetuning in many settings [Hu et al., 2023].

              A hallmark of current state-of-the-art PEFTs is that they modify weights rather than representations.
                    However, much prior interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich semantic
                       information, suggesting that editing representations might be a more powerful alternative to weight
                       updates. In this paper, we pursue this hypothesis by developing and motivating Representation
                    Finetuning (ReFT). Instead of adapting model weights, ReFT methods train interventions that
                     manipulate a small fraction of model representations in order to steer model behaviors to solve
                    downstream tasks at inference time. ReFT methods are drop-in replacements for weight-based PEFTs.
                      This approach is inspired by recent work in LM interpretability that intervenes on representations to
                          find faithful causal mechanisms [Geiger et al., 2023b] and to steer model behaviours at inference time
                       [Turner et al., 2023, Li et al., 2024], and it can be seen as a generalisation of the representation-editing
                   work of Wu et al. [2024a], Turner et al. [2023], and Zou et al. [2023] (see appendix B for details).

Figure 1: Parameter count vs. performance for LoReFT and other PEFTs across four benchmarks
when applied to LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and RoBERTa models. Despite training far fewer
parameters than existing PEFTs, LoReFT achieves competitive or even state-of-the-art performance
on all tasks.  Its value is most apparent for the largest models in our evaluations. Note: FT is
full-parameter finetuning, which is not a PEFT or ReFT method. Additional results are in section 4.


We focus on a strong and highly efficient instance of the ReFT family that we call Low-rank
Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT). LoReFT is a parametrisation of ReFT that intervenes on hidden
representations in the linear subspace spanned by a low-rank projection matrix, building directly
on the distributed alignment search (DAS) method of Geiger et al. [2023b] and Wu et al. [2023].
We also identify an ablation of this method (DiReFT) that trades some performance for increased
efficiency. We evaluate our ReFTs on LLaMA-family models and small-scale LMs against existing
PEFTs on standard benchmarks from four domains: commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning,
instruction-following, and natural language understanding. Compared to LoRA, we find that LoReFT
uses 15×–65× times fewer parameters while achieving state-of-the-art performance on commonsense
reasoning, instruction-following, and natural language understanding against the strongest PEFTs.
These findings indicate that ReFT methods are worthy of further exploration, as they may emerge as
more efficient and effective alternatives to weight-based PEFTs.

Parameter-efficient finetuning methods (PEFTs). PEFTs train a fraction of the model’s parameters
to adapt it to downstream tasks. We classify PEFTs into three categories:

  1. Adapter-based methods train additional modules (e.g. fully-connected layers) on top of the
     frozen pretrained model. Series adapters insert components between LM attention or MLP
     layers [Houlsby et al., 2019, Pfeiffer et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2022, He et al., 2022b, Fu et al.,
     2021], while parallel adapters add modules alongside existing components [He et al., 2022a].
     Since adapters add new components that cannot be easily folded into existing model weights,
     they impose an additional burden at inference time.1
  2. LoRA [Hu et al., 2022] and DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c] use low-rank matrices to approximate
     additive weight updates during training, and require no additional overhead during inference
     since the weight updates can be merged into the model. These are the strongest PEFTs currently.2
  3. Prompt-based methods add randomly-initialised soft tokens to the input (usually as a prefix)
    and train their embeddings while keeping the LM weights frozen [Li and Liang, 2021]. These

   1Several very recent papers introduce new adapter architectures but do not benchmark them on the tasks
we consider, or they perform hyperparameter-tuning in a different setup than done in this work. These include:
LLaMA-Adapter [Zhang et al., 2024b], LLaMA-Adapter v2 [Gao et al., 2023], Aligner [Ziheng et al., 2023].

    methods are often far from optimal compared to other PEFTs, and come at the cost of significant
     inference overhead. A variant of this method where hidden-layer activations are also tuned was
     introduced as a baseline in Hu et al. [2022], with better performance.

Representation editing. Recent work on activation steering and representation engineering shows
that adding fixed or task-specific steering vectors [Subramani et al., 2022, Turner et al., 2023, Zou
et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2024b, Vogel, 2024, Li et al., 2024] or applying concept erasure [Ravfogel
et al., 2022, Belrose et al., 2023, Avitan et al., 2024, Singh et al., 2024] to the residual stream can
enable a degree of control over pretrained LM generations without the need for resource-intensive
finetuning [Wu et al., 2024a]. The success of these methods affirms that representations induced by
pretrained LMs carry rich semantic structure.

Interventional interpretability. Much recent work has used interventions on model-internal states
to test hypotheses about how LMs implement various behaviours. In particular, interventions on linear
subspaces of representations have provided increasing evidence that human-interpretable concepts are
encoded linearly [Smolensky, 1986, Rumelhart et al., 1986, McClelland et al., 1986]. This includes
linguistic features such as gender and number [Lasri et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023, Hanna et al.,
2023, Chintam et al., 2023, Yamakoshi et al., 2023, Hao and Linzen, 2023, Chen et al., 2023, Amini
et al., 2023, Guerner et al., 2023, Arora et al., 2024], logical and mathematical reasoning [Wu et al.,
2023], entity attributes [Huang et al., 2024], and a number of other domains [Mikolov et al., 2013,
Elhage et al., 2022, Park et al., 2023, Nanda et al., 2023, Guerner et al., 2023].

3  ReFT

We now define the ReFT family of methods. To do this, we first summarize the core motivation,
which emerges from work on intervention-based model interpretability. We then show how this leads
directly to Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT). Finally, we generalize this to a family of
ReFT methods. Appendix A provides a brief overview of our generic ReFT training library.

To keep the presentation simple, we assume throughout that our target model is a Transformer-
based [Vaswani et al., 2017] LM that produces contextualised representations of sequences of tokens.
Given a sequence of n input tokens x = (x1,...,xn), the model first embeds these into a list of
representations h(0) = (h(0)1  ,...,h(0)n  ). Then, m layers successively compute the j-th list of hidden
representations h(j) as a function of the previous list of hidden representations h(j−1). Each hidden
representation is a vector h ∈Rd. The LM uses the final hidden representations h(m) to produce its
predictions. In our experiments, we consider both autoregressive LMs and masked LMs [Devlin et al.,
2019]. An autoregressive LM predicts p(xn+1 ∣x1,...,xn) = softmax(Wh(m)n   ), while a masked
LM predicts p(xi ∣x1,...,xi−1,xi+1,...,xn) = softmax(Wh(m)i   ), where W is a learned matrix
mapping from representations to logits over the vocabulary space.

3.1  Motivation

In interpretability research, the framework of causal abstraction [Geiger et al., 2021] uses interchange
interventions to establish the causal role of representations in deep learning models. An interchange
intervention fixes a representation to the value it would take if a counterfactual input were processed
by the model. Experiments investigating how such interventions affect model behavior form the
evidence for claims about the causal role of a representation and the concept it encodes.

To test whether a concept is encoded in a linear subspace of a representation, one may use a dis-
tributed interchange intervention (DII) [Geiger et al., 2023b].3 Let b be the hidden representation
created at row i and column k when our model processes input b, and let s be the corresponding
representation when that same model processes input s. A distributed interchange intervention on b
given a counterfactual source representation s is then defined as

                          DII(b,s,R) = b + R⊺(Rs −Rb)                               (1)

where R ∈Rr×d is a low-rank projection matrix with orthonormal rows, d is the representation
dimensionality, and r is the dimensionality of the subspace we are intervening on. We learn the
subspace R using distributed alignment search (DAS), which finds the subspace that maximises the

   3This notion of subspace intervention was also independently discovered by Guerner et al. [2023].

probability of the expected counterfactual output after intervention [Geiger et al., 2023b]. DAS is
highly expressive, and can effectively localize concepts within model representations [Wu et al., 2023,
Arora et al., 2024, Wu et al., 2024c, Huang et al., 2024]. This suggests that subspace representation
interventions could also be a powerful tool for model control.

3.2  Two low-rank ReFT instantiations

LoReFT. The formulation of DII in eq. (1) immediately suggests a way to control model generations
via interventions. The guiding intuition is that we can learn how to perform interventions that steer
the model towards predicting our task labels. The resulting method, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT
(LoReFT), is defined by the following variant of eq. (1):
                         ΦLoReFT(h) = h + R⊺(Wh + b −Rh)                            (2)

This is identical to eq. (1), except we use a learned projected source Rs = Wh + b. LoReFT thus
edits the representation in the r-dimensional subspace spanned by the rows of R to take on the
values obtained from our linear projection Wh + b. We depict this operation in fig. 2. The learned
parameters are ϕ = {R,W,b}; the parameters of the LM are frozen. As with DII, R ∈Rr×d is a
low-rank matrix with orthonormal rows where d is the hidden-state dimensionality and r ≤d is the
rank of the subspace. We further define a linear projection W ∈Rr×d and bias vector b ∈Rr.

DiReFT. In addition, we define an ablation of LoReFT which removes the orthogonality constraint
and the difference operation, reducing training time:
                           ΦDiReFT(h) = h + W⊺2 (W1h + b)                              (3)
Both W1,W2 ∈Rr×d are low-rank projection matrices. Note that eq. (3) resembles LoRA, and thus
DiReFT can be thought of as LoRA applied directly to hidden representations at certain positions.4
Empirical evidence from previous work suggests that adding orthogonal constraints to LoRA weights
increases performance [Liu et al., 2024d]. (Appendix E reports results for additional ablations of
LoReFT.)

Training objective. We consider both generation tasks using decoder-only or encoder–decoder
LMs and classification tasks using encoder-only models. The pretrained language model induces a
distribution over token sequences p(⋅). We denote the model that results from the ReFT intervention
Φ on p(⋅) as pΦ(⋅) with trainable parameters ϕ. To simplify notation, we refer to the hidden
representations produced by the LM on input x as h(x), and those by the intervened LM as hΦ(x).

For generation tasks, our training objective is language modelling. Given an input sequence x =
(x1,...,xn) with n tokens as the prompt, the goal is to predict the output sequence y = (y1,...,ym)

   4LoRA is not applicable to the residual stream, which is weightless. LoRA can be configured to apply only
to the attention layer output projection matrix, which is similar to our residual stream intervention. However,
previous works found that applying LoRA only to attention layers is sub-optimal [Hu et al., 2023].

with m tokens. We minimise the cross-entropy loss with teacher-forcing over all output positions.

                         min {− ∑ log pΦ (yi ∣xy<i)}                                 (4)
                              ϕ                                              i=1

For single-label classification tasks, we add a classification head Hθ(⋅) with parameters θ that takes
the final-layer representation at the first token (CLS) as input and outputs a distribution over classes.
H has the learned parameters θ = {Wo,bo,Wd,bd}.
                Hθ(⋅∣h) = softmax(Wo(tanh(Wdh(m)1  + bd)) + bo)                   (5)

We learn the parameters of the head and those of the intervention function Φ. We minimise the
cross-entropy loss of the target class y given input x:

                          min {−log Hθ(y ∣hΦ(x))}                                  (6)
                                        ϕ,θ

3.3  The ReFT family of methods

It is straightforward to generalise the above intervention functions to define a family of intervention-
based representation finetuning methods. We first define a general notion of intervention, i.e. the
modification of hidden representations during the model forward pass:
Definition 3.1. An intervention I is a tuple ⟨Φ,P,l⟩that encapsulates a single inference-time
modification of the representations computed by a Transformer-based LM. The three components of
an intervention are (1) the intervention function Φ ∶Rd →Rd with learned parameters ϕ, (2) a set
of input positions P ⊆{1,...,n} that the intervention is applied to, and (3) the layer l ∈{1,...,m}
at which the intervention is applied.

We implement the intervention I as the following operation that overwrites some representations h:
                            h(l) ←(Φ(h(l)p ) if p ∈P else h(l)p  )p∈1,...,n                          (7)

The intervention is applied immediately after the computation of h(l) and thus affects the representa-
tions computed in later layers h(l+1),...,h(m).

Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of an intervention. A ReFT is then defined as a constrained
set of non-overlapping interventions:
Definition 3.2. A ReFT method is a set of f interventions I = {I1,...,If}. We enforce that for
any two interventions Ij,Ik ∈I such that they operate on the same layer lj = lk, their intervention
positions must be disjoint, i.e. Pj ∩Pk = ∅. The parameters (ϕ1,...,ϕf) of all of the intervention
functions are independent.

ReFT is thus a generic framework encompassing interventions on hidden representations during the
model forward pass. In appendix B, we show how a variety of existing inference-time intervention
methods can be described within this framework.

4  Experiments

To evaluate our ReFTs against existing PEFTs, we conduct experiments across four diverse NLP
benchmarks covering more than 20 datasets (extensive details on our datasets are in appendix C).
Our goal is to provide a rich picture of how LoReFT and DiReFT perform in different scenarios. We
experiment with both masked and autoregressive LMs at different scales, ranging from RoBERTa-
base [Liu et al., 2019] with 125M to LLaMA models [Touvron et al., 2023a,b] with 13B parameters.
We benchmark against existing PEFTs such as prefix-tuning [Li and Liang, 2021], adapter-tuning
with both Series Adapters and Parallel Adapters, BitFit [Ben Zaken et al., 2022], RED [Wu et al.,
2024a], LoRA [Hu et al., 2022], and DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c]. Our comparisons focus on both
performance and parameter efficiency. In our comparisons, we use hyperparameter-tuned scores from
previous works when possible. We load our base LMs in torch.bfloat16 to save memory. All of
our experiments are run with a single GPU: NVIDIA A100 40G/80G or RTX 6000. Examples of
raw model generations are in appendix I.

4.1  Hyperparameter configuration

For our experiments, we must decide how many interventions to learn and which layers and input
positions to apply each one on. We propose learning interventions on a fixed number of p prefix and
s suffix positions in the prompt. Specifically, we tune four hyperparameters:

  1. The number of prefix positions p to intervene on, i.e. positions {1,...,p}.
  2. The number of suffix positions s to intervene on, i.e. positions {n −s + 1,...,n}.
  3. Which set of layers L to intervene on.
  4. Whether or not to tie intervention parameters ϕ across different positions in the same layer.

This simplifies the hyperparameter search space; compared to LoRA, the only additional consideration
is which positions to intervene on. Since the number of positions edited is constant, LoReFT and
DiReFT contribute a fixed additional inference cost that does not scale with prompt length.

Given the positions P = {1,...,p} ∪{n −s + 1,...,n}, we define the untied and tied variants:

                   Iuntied = {⟨Φ,{p},l⟩∣p ∈P,l ∈L}                 Itied = {⟨Φ,P,l⟩∣l ∈L}

Additionally, when applying LoReFT and DiReFT to a prompt with length n where n < p + s, we
set p ←min(p,⌊n/2⌋) and s ←min(s,⌈n/2⌉) and do not apply the truncated interventions in Iuntied.
We also tune neural-network training hyperparameters.

Unlike previous work [Hu et al., 2022, 2023, Liu et al., 2024c] where hyperparameter tuning
may involve optimising performance directly on test sets, we only tune our hyperparameters on
development sets which do not contain any overlapping examples with the test sets of our tasks. We
further describe hyperparameter tuning for each benchmark in appendix D.1.

4.2  Commonsense reasoning

We replicate the experimental setup in Hu  et  al. [2023] and finetune LLaMA-1 7B/13B,
Llama-2 7B, and Llama-3 8B5 on a combined dataset of eight commonsense reasoning tasks
(COMMONSENSE170K). We report scores on each task’s test set individually. We compare with
PEFTs benchmarked in Hu et al. [2023] as well as the identical experiment reported in Liu et al.
[2024c] for DoRA.

Datasets. Our benchmark contains eight commonsense reasoning datasets, including BoolQ [Clark
et al., 2019], PIQA [Bisk et al., 2020], SIQA [Sap et al., 2019], HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019],
WinoGrande [Sakaguchi et al., 2021], ARC-e, ARC-c [Clark et al., 2018], and OBQA [Mihaylov
et al., 2018]. Examples are formulated as multiple-choice problems where the model needs to directly
generate the correct choice without rationales. We use the same prompt template as in Hu et al.
[2023] with additional string normalisation (removing leading and trailing whitespace).

Hyperparameter tuning. We do not do hyperparameter selection based on test set results. Rather,
we use the hyperparameter settings of the model that performs best on a development set created
from the GSM8K training set, except we use a lower number of epochs (6 instead of 12) because
the COMMONSENSE170K training set is more than 20 times larger than GSM8K. This allows us to
tune relevant hyperparamters, and also serves to test the robustness of these settings across different
domains. We additionally report scores on 3 epochs in appendix D.3.

Results. We report results in table 1. LoReFT sets state-of-the-art performance on the commonsense
reasoning tasks, outperforming all other methods by a considerable margin. While being more
compute-efficient, DiReFT achieves only slightly worse performance consistently.

4.3  Arithmetic reasoning

Similar to the previous experiment, we follow the experimental setup in Hu et al. [2023] and finetune
LLaMA-1 7B and 13B on a combined dataset of seven arithmetic reasoning tasks with LM-generated
chain-of-thought steps (MATH10K) and report scores on four of the tasks’ test sets. We only evaluate
correctness on the final numeric or multiple-choice answer.

   5Llama-3 8B appeared on April 18, 2024, and thus we had time to complete only commonsense reasoning
experiments with this model. Liu et al. [2024c] report corresponding results for LoRA and DoRA.

Hyperparameter tuning. We use the same hyperparameter settings as for the Commonsense Rea-
soning benchmark, but with 12 epochs for training. We also report scores on 3 epochs.

Datasets. Our benchmark contains four datasets for math world problems, including AQuA [Ling
et al., 2017], GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], MAWPS [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016], and SVAMP [Pa-
tel et al., 2021]. Models need to generate chain-of-thought [Wei et al., 2022] before the final answer.
We use the same prompt template and hyperparameter settings as in the previous experiment.

Results. We report results in table 2. We find that both LoReFT and DiReFT do not perform as
well at arithmetic reasoning tasks compared to LoRA and adapters, but do outperform prefix-tuning.
Our results suggest that our ReFTs may have more trouble on chain-of-thought reasoning than the
single-step commonsense reasoning tasks due to the length of generations (greater length necessarily
reduces the effect of the intervention) and overall greater difficulty of the task. Our results show that
our ReFTs perform better with the 13B model than the 7B model, which suggests that our methods
scale with model size. Overall, we note that the arithmetic reasoning results show a lot of variation,
with no single method emerging as a clear winner across all of them.

4.4  Instruction-following

Base LMs require instruction finetuning to follow human prompts [Ouyang et al., 2022]. We follow
the experimental setup in Wu et al. [2024a] and finetune Llama-2 7B with Ultrafeedback [Cui et al.,
2023]. We compare against full parameter finetuning, LoRA, and RED. For evaluation, we use
Alpaca-Eval v1.0 [Li et al., 2023], which computes the win-rate against text-davinci-003 using
GPT-4 as the annotator. We use the same prompt template as in Taori et al. [2023].

Datasets. Ultrafeedback is high-quality instruction dataset where responses are generated via scoring
a diverse set of model responses from a list of candidates (e.g. ChatGPT and Bard). The score
is calculated as a weighted score of instruction-following, truthfulness, honesty, and helpfulness.

Some of the best 7B and 13B chat-models (e.g. UltraLM-13B [Ding et al., 2023]) are finetuned with
Ultrafeedback.

Hyperparameter tuning. We do hyperparameter-tuning on the unseen instruction-following dataset
Alpaca-52K [Taori et al., 2023] with only LLaMA-7B to prevent test-set hill-climbing. We then
use the hyperparameter settings of our best performing model to finetune on Ultrafeedback. For
hyperparameter tuning, we use Alpaca-Eval v1.0 with GPT-4 turbo as the annotator for fast turnaround,
which also prevents overfitting with GPT-4 as a judge.

Results. We report results in table 3. When matched in parameter count to the previous most
parameter-efficient PEFT (RED) and trained on Llama-2 7B, LoReFT outperforms all reported
finetuning methods (including full finetuning) and achieves a win-rate within 1% of GPT-3.5 Turbo
1106. Furthermore, after halving the parameter count or using only 1/64-th of the data, LoReFT still
outperforms other finetuning methods. This result shows that LoReFT can succeed at long-form text
generation. DiReFT is again slightly worse than LoReFT but is highly competitive. 6

   6We release our ReFT weights (<1MB) of our instruction-tuned model through HuggingFace and provide a
tutorial at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft/blob/main/examples/chat.

4.5  Natural language understanding

We evaluate LoReFT on the GLUE benchmark [Wang et al., 2018] against existing PEFTs. We use
this set of experiments to show LoReFT works well even with small-scale LMs, and can improve
representations for classification tasks and not just text generation. We finetune RoBERTa-base
(125M) as well as RoBERTa-large (350M) on GLUE, a sequence classification benchmark for natural
language understanding (NLU) which covers domains such as sentiment classification and natural
language inference. Details about the GLUE benchmark can be found in its original paper. We
follow Wu et al. [2024a] for proper evaluation on GLUE validation set: we split the validation set into
two sets guarded by a random seed, and we pick the best model with highest in-training validation
accuracy to evaluate on the other held-out half for testing accuracy.

Hyperparameter tuning. We tune our hyperparameters for each task separately. which is standard
for PEFTs. To avoid overfitting to random seeds, we hyperparameter-tune our models with a
constant seed, and report averaged results over that and four additional unseen seeds. We describe
hyperparameter tuning experiments in Appendix D.1.

Results. We report results in table 4. LoReFT obtains comparable performance with PEFT methods
on both model sizes when parameter matched with RED, the previous most parameter-efficient PEFT
for this task. Furthermore, DiReFT achieves worse performance than most of the PEFTs suggesting
LoReFT is a better choice when LM is small. Full results with standard deviation is in table 13. We
additionally compare against VeRA [Kopiczko et al., 2024] in appendix D.3.

5  Limitations

Due to limited resources, we mainly explored the LLaMA-family of models. In future work, we hope
to explore the effectiveness of ReFT on other model families as well as vision–language models such
as LLaVA [Liu et al., 2024a]. The capabilities of ReFT have not yet been fully explored due to the
large hyperparameter search space; we are interested in automating this search. We provide some
initial explorations of LM personalisation with ReFT in a few-shot setting in appendix G.2. We hope
to explore why ReFT works, and we provide some of our early explorations focused on memorisation
(appendix F.1, appendix F.2). We are also investigating whether learned orthogonal subspaces can be
composed together without adaptation. Some encouraging initial findings are in appendix G.1.

ReFT, abstraction, and generation. Neural network interpretability research often struggles to
contribute directly to improving models. With ReFT, we have shown one way to overcome this
challenge. The ReFT framework is rooted in work on causal abstraction [Geiger et al., 2023a] for
model interpretability, and LoReFT builds directly on the distributed interchange intervention method


                                       9

of Geiger et al. [2023b] and Wu et al. [2023]. See also the interchange intervention training (IIT)
method of Geiger et al. [2022], Wu et al. [2022], Huang et al. [2023c]. In a similar vein, recent work
also uses representation-based editing of the Transformer stream to steer model behavior [Li et al.,
2024, Zou et al., 2023]. ReFT advances this line of work by showing one way that such steering can
be learned, rather than being merely a post hoc analysis step.

The precise ways in which ReFT works deserve deeper exploration. Although these methods intervene
on representations, the causal effect of such interventions may only emerge in the model’s upstream
computations. In other words, the power of ReFT may come from the fact that it creates new causal
pathways or modifies the strength of some existing ones. We leave it to future research to track these
effects, and perhaps to explore more structured ReFTs to modify complex causal pathways in LMs.

ReFT and model interpretability. ReFT relies on insights from work on interpretability, and it may
also be able to contribute insights back to that field. In particular, LoReFT shows that training a set
of low-rank interventions on selected residual streams can induce a base LM to follow instructions
(section 4.4). In other words, a linear subspace distributed across a set of neurons can achieve
generalised control over a vast number of tasks. This is a serious challenge to work seeing to interpret
individual neurons in isolation (for related criticisms, see Huang et al. 2023b). The success of ReFT
suggests to us a quite different approach to interperetability, one that starts from the assumption that
neurons will play different roles in different contexts.

Evaluation practices in PEFT research. In this work, we hyperparameter-tune ReFT on develop-
ment sets that do not overlap with the test set. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of the literature
on PEFTs directly hill-climbs performance on test sets. This results in overfitting to specific tasks,
which gives practitioners less certainty about the real-world performance of different methods and
impedes fair comparison. We hope that future work can introduce benchmarks for evaluating PEFTs
and ReFTs. These should allow for compute- or time-matched hyperparameter-tuning comparisons,
and they should disallow any kind of tuning or model selection based on the test set.

6  Conclusion

We propose a strong alternative to PEFTs, LoReFT, and we identify an ablation of this method,
DiReFT, that trades some performance for increased efficiency. Overall, LoReFT achieves strong per-
formance across benchmarks from four domains while being 15×–65× more efficient than LoRA. No-
tably, LoReFT establishes new state-of-the-art performance on commonsense reasoning, instruction-
following, and natural language understanding against the strongest PEFTs. We also show how our
method can be described under a generic framework – ReFT. ReFT is a new approach to finetuning
that is more powerful, more parameter-efficient, and more interpretable than any existing PEFTs.

A  pyreft: A ReFT-native Python Library

To lower the cost of switching from PEFTs to ReFT, we release a Python library made for training
and sharing ReFTs. Our library is built on top of pyvene [Wu et al., 2024b], a library for performing
and training activation interventions on arbitrary PyTorch models. Any pretrained LM available
on HuggingFace is supported through our library for finetuning with ReFT methods, and finetuned
models can be easily uploaded to HuggingFace. The following example shows steps to wrap a
Llama-2 7B model with a single intervention on the residual stream output of the 19-th layer:

  import torch
  import transformers
  from pyreft import get_reft_model , ReftConfig , LoreftIntervention , ReftTrainerForCausalLM

  # loading huggingface model
  model_name_or_path = "yahma/llama -7b-hf"
  model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
      model_name_or_path , torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16 , device_map="cuda")
  # wrap the model with rank -1 loreft
  reft_config = ReftConfig(representations ={
      "layer": 19, "component": "block_output",
      "intervention": LoreftIntervention(
      embed_dim=model.config.hidden_size , low_rank_dimension =1)})
  reft_model = get_reft_model(model , reft_config)
  reft_model.print_trainable_parameters ()



The wrapped model can be trained for downstream tasks. We also provide data loading helpers to
construct training data that is compatible with HuggingFace trainers:

  tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)

  # get training data with customised dataloaders
  data_module = make_supervised_data_module(
      tokenizer=tokenizer , model=model , layers =[19] ,
      training_args=training_args , data_args=data_args)
  # train
  trainer = reft.ReftTrainerForCausalLM(
      model=reft_model , tokenizer=tokenizer , args=training_args , ** data_module)
  trainer.train()
  trainer.save_model(output_dir=training_args.output_dir)


B  Describing existing methods under the ReFT framework

To show the expressivity of the ReFT framework, we cast existing representing-editing methods in
the literature into ReFTs.

General comments about expressivity of ReFT. Given that previous works have unified PEFTs
under a single framework [He et al., 2022a], one may ask why not express ReFT as a PEFT
method? The main reason is that PEFT frameworks lack the notion of time or sequence (see the
unified PEFT view provided in Table 1 on pg. 5 of He et al., 2022a). In PEFTs, representation
modifications are necessarily applied to every token in the sequence, even in recent variants such as
AdaLoRA [Zhang et al., 2023]. A key aspect of ReFT is that it leverages representations over time
and intervenes only on a small number of them while being effective. More importantly, the notation
of time is important for future versions of ReFT that intervene on representations schematically
(e.g. intervene on the first token at some early layers and then intervene on the last token at some later
layers). The ability to intervene at different layer and position combinations schematically is also
supported in our code. Existing PEFT libraries 7 enforce weight-based updates without supporting
flexible representation-based interventions.

B.1 RED

RED [Wu et al., 2024a] is a simple representation-editing method that applies an element-wise scaling
transform s ∈Rn and adds a bias b ∈Rn to the hidden representation in every layer. The same
intervention is applied to every position (including at generated tokens, increasing inference burden)

   7See https://github.com/huggingface/peft.


                                       20

but separate interventions are learned at each layer. In the ReFT framework, RED is defined as

                  ΦRED(h) = s × h + b                                                     (8)
                        IRED = {⟨ΦRED,{1,...,n},l⟩∣l ∈{1,...,m}}                      (9)

The parameters ϕRED = {s,b} are learned with gradient descent to minimise a loss function such as
language-modelling loss or a classification loss, as in our experiments with LoReFT. We believe that
RED is better classified as a kind of adapter due to its application at all positions.

B.2  Activation addition

Activation addition [Turner et al., 2023] takes the difference in activations at at some positions p and
q and layer l given two contrastive prompts x+ and x−as input. It then adds this difference vector,
scaled by a tuned constant c, to representations at all positions in layer l for some new prompt.
                             a = h(x+)(l)p  −h(x−)(l)q                               (10)
                          ΦActAdd(h) = h + c ⋅a                                         (11)
                                   IActAdd = {⟨ϕActAdd,{1,...,n},l⟩}                         (12)

B.3  RepE

Zou et al. [2023] introduce several intervention methods for controlling model behaviour, which they
term representation engineering.

First, given a set of prompts {x1,...,xn} designed to elicit the presence of a concept, we randomly
pair them, take the difference in activations for each pair, and find the first principle component of the
difference vectors at the last token position in some layer of interest l to obtain a reading vector:
                        areading = PCA({h(xi)(l)−1 −h(xi+1)(l)−1 ∣i ≡0 mod 2})                  (13)                                                                             1
One can also used a more structured pairing of constrastive prompts to obtain a contrast vector,
similar to the difference vector computed in activation addition:
                           acontrast = PCA({h(x+i )(l)−1 −h(x−i )(l)−1 ∣1 ≤i ≤n})                   (14)                                                                           1
Then, using either areading or acontrast, RepE introduces three operators (i.e. parametrisations of Φ)
for intervening on activations:

                                 ΦRepE,linear(h) = h ± c ⋅a                                    (15)
                              ΦRepE,piecewise(h) = h + c ⋅sign(a ⋅h) ⋅a                        (16)
                                            ⋅h                               ΦRepE,projection(h) = h −c ⋅a   ⋅a                              (17)
                                                 ∥a∥2

The first two of these are similar to activation addition, while the latter is a scaled one-dimensional
distributed interchange intervention that is a special case of LoReFT. These operations are then used
to intervene on some set of positions P ⊆{1,...,n} in the layer of interest:

                                     IRepE = {⟨ΦRepE,P,l⟩}                                 (18)

RepE introduces another model control method called Low-Rank Representation Adaptation
(LoRRA), which is a kind of PEFT rather than a ReFT since it tunes model weights using a variant of
LoRA.

C  Datasets

C.1  Commonsense reasoning

We train and evaluate our models on eight datasets covering different domains of open-ended QA
tasks:

      1. The BoolQ [Clark et al., 2019] dataset, which is a question-answering dataset for yes or
       no naturally occurring questions. We remove the provided passage in the dataset following
         previous works to ensure a fair comparison.


                                       21

      2. The PIQA [Bisk et al., 2020] dataset, which tests physical commonsense reasoning and
         requires the model to choose one of the provided actions to take based on a hypothesised
         scenario.
      3. The SIQA [Sap et al., 2019] dataset, which focus on reasoning about people’s actions and
          their corresponding social consequences.
      4. The HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019] dataset, which asks the model to choose an appropriate
        ending (or sentence completion) given a context.
      5. The WinoGrande [Sakaguchi et al., 2021] dataset, inspired by Winograd Schema Chal-
        lenge [Levesque et al., 2012], asks the model to fill-in-a-blank with binary options given a
        sentence which requires commonsense reasoning.
      6. The ARC Easy set (ARC-e [Clark et al., 2018]), which includes genuine grade-school level
         multiple-choice science questions
      7. The ARC Challenge set (ARC-c) [Clark et al., 2018]), which is like ARC-e but designed in
        a way that co-occurrence methods are expected to fail to answer correctly.
      8. The OBQA [Mihaylov et al., 2018] dataset, which is a knowledge-intensive and open-book
     QA dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning. Dataset statistics and simplified training
        examples from each dataset are provided in Hu et al. [2023].

Dataset statistics and simplified training examples from each dataset are provided in Hu et al. [2023].
We replicate the experimental setup in Hu et al. [2023] and finetune our models on a combined training
dataset (COMMONSENSE170K) of the tasks mentioned above, and evaluate on their individual test
set.

C.2  Arithmetic reasoning

We train and evaluate with seven datasets covering different domains of math world problems:

      1. The AddSub [Hosseini et al., 2014] dataset, which involves solving arithmetic word prob-
        lems that include addition and subtraction.
      2. The AQuA [Ling et al., 2017] dataset, which formulates algebraic word problems as
         multiple-choice problems.
      3. The GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021] dataset, which consists of grade-school math word
        problems that require multi-step reasoning.
      4. The MAWPS [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016] dataset, which contains math word problem
        with varying complexity.
      5. The MultiArith [Roy and Roth, 2015] dataset, which contains multi-step arithmetic prob-
         lems.
      6. The SingleEq [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2015] dataset, which has grade-school math word
        problems that map to single equations with different length.
      7. The SVAMP [Patel et al., 2021] dataset, which enhances the original Math World Prob-
       lem (MWP) challenge by requiring robust reasoning ability that is invariant to structural
         alternations of the posing problem.

Dataset statistics and simplified training examples from each dataset are provided in Hu et al. [2023].
We replicate the experimental setup in Hu et al. [2023] and finetune our models on a combined
training dataset (MATH10K) of four tasks mentioned above: GSM8K, MAWPS, MAWPS-single
and AQuA. Different from Hu et al. [2023], selected tasks are excluded for testing since the original
paper accidentally leaks testing examples from these tasks into the training set, affecting AddSub,
MultiArith and SingleEq. They are included in the MAWPS training dataset, and thus leaked into the
training dataset.

C.3  Natural language understanding

We follow Wu et al. [2024a] for proper evaluation on the GLUE validation set. We split the validation
set into two subsets, using one subset guarded by a random seed for in-training evaluation and the
other for testing. Specifically, after each training epoch, we evaluate the model on our in-training


                                       22

evaluation set and select the best model across all epochs for testing. For datasets with a large
validation set (i.e., QQP, MNLI, and QNLI), we select 1,000 samples for in-training evaluation. For
the remaining smaller datasets, we select half of the samples for this purpose. For the evaluation
metric, we use the Matthews correlation coefficient for CoLA, the Pearson correlation coefficient for
STS-B, and accuracy for the other datasets. For MNLI, we report results only on the matched version.

D  Hyperparameters

D.1  Hyperparameter tuning and decoding strategy

Commonsense reasoning and arithmeric reasoning. We create a standalone development set by
taking the last 300 examples from the GSM8K training set. We train our models with the remaining
training set of GSM8K and select the hyperparameter settings based on model performance on the
development set. We select the hyperparameters using LLaMA-7B, and apply the same settings to
LLaMA-13B without additional tuning. We use a maximum sequence length of 512 for training and
hyperparameter tuning, and a maximum new token number of 32 for inference. Table 5 and table 6
describes our hyperparameter search space. We use a lower number of epochs (6 instead of 12) for
the commonsense reasoning benchmark because the COMMONSENSE170K training set is more than
20 times larger than GSM8K.

During inference, we use greedy decoding without sampling for the commonsense reasoning bench-
mark, since it is a multi-token classification benchmark, and use the same decoding strategy as in
Hu et al. [2023] for the arithmetic reasoning benchmark with a higher temperature 0.3. The reason
to switch to a slightly different set of decoding hyperparameters is that the HuggingFace decoding
function may throw an error due to statistical instability with close-to-zero probabilities over output
tokens with beam search.8

Instruction following. We finetune LLaMA-7B on Alpaca-52K [Taori et al., 2023] to select hy-
perparameters. We select the hyperparameter settings based on model performance evaluated with
Alpaca-Eval v1.0 [Li et al., 2023], which calculates the win-rate over text-davinci-003 by using
gpt-4-turbo as the annotator. We use a maximum sequence length of 768 for training and hyper-
parameter tuning, and a maximum new token number of 2048 for inference. Table 7 describes our
hyperparameter search space.

During inference, we use the same decoding strategy as in RED [Wu et al., 2024a] to ensure a fair
comparison. Specifically, we use greedy decoding without sampling, and use a maximum repetition
n-gram size of 5 with a repetition penalty of 1.1.

Natural language understanding. We conduct hyperparameter tuning with RoBERTa-base and
RoBERTa-large for each task individually. We pick the hyperparameters based on testing performance
on the held-out validation set with a fixed random seed of 42. We then evaluate our model with
additional four unseen seeds {43, 44, 45, 46} for final results. We follow Wu et al. [2024a]’s setting
for evaluation. For QQP with RoBERTa-large, there are some stochasticity in runs with the same
seed, so we picked the best run out of 3 runs for any particular seed. As reported by Wu et al. [2024a],
we also observe that evaluation results on RTE are unstable due to the small size of the dataset. We
thus replace several random seeds as in Wu et al. [2024a] to ensure a fair comparison. In addition, we
replace one or two random seeds for CoLA for stability. Table 8 describes our hyperparameter search
space. Table 9 to table 12 describe our hyperparameter settings for each task.

We conduct separate hyperparameter tuning for LoReFT and DiReFT to ensure a fair comparison.

D.2  Suggestions on choosing hyperparameters for ReFT

Similar to PEFTs or finetuning, ReFT can be sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Here, we recom-
mand a non-exhaustive list for choosing the best hyperparameter settings for your tasks:

        • Intervening on multiple positions delivers significant gains. We find that intervening only
       on a single token position (e.g., just the first one or the last one) is always less optimal than
         intervening on multiple tokens. However, intervening on excessive number of tokens might
       harm performance by slowing down convergence.
        • Intervening on all layers first, and then shrink down. Intervening on all layers often
        provides a good baseline. We recommand users to start with all layers, and shrink down
         the number of intervening layers depending on the desired performance–parameter count
         balance.
        • Higher rank may not entail better performance. High rank entails higher parameter
         count, but it does not always bring performance gain (likely due to slower convergence). We
       recommend users to start with a rank that is lower than 32 (e.g. rank 4).
        • Tie intervention weights as much as you can. In the paper, we explore tying the interven-
          tion weights between prefix and suffix token positions. It automatically halves the parameter
         count, and it can result in better performance as well. We suspect weight sharing across
         layers may also help.
        • Hyperparameter tuning with learning rate, warmup ratio, dropout rate and weight
       decay should go after other hyperparameters. These classic neural-network training
        hyperparameters can play a role, yet they have much smaller effect than previous ones.

D.3  Additional hyperparameter-tuning results of LoReFT

As a result of our hyperparameter searching process, LoReFT is trained with more epochs compared to
LoRA [Hu et al., 2022] or DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c]. This raises the concern whether our performance
gain is purely due to the larger number of epochs. We thus rerun our experiments with the exact same
number of epochs and effective batch size as LoRA or DoRA. Results are shown in table 14 and
table 15. With matched hyperparameters, LoReFT shows similar results by outperforming previous
methods significantly on eight commonsense reasoning datasets.

Recently, VeRA was proposed as a new variant of LoRA that further reduces the number of trainable
parameters while maintaining performance [Kopiczko et al., 2024]. Table 16 shows our results
compared against VeRA as well as the baseline numbers reported in VeRA’s paper. We include this
set of results in the appendix, given that the hyperparameter tuning process is drastically different

validation set, which could cause overfitting since results are selected based on test set performance.

Table 14: Accuracy comparison of LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B against existing PEFT methods on
eight commonsense reasoning datasets. ∗Performance results of all baseline methods are taken from
Liu et al. [2024c]. We report averaged performance of three runs with distinct random seeds for our
method. For LoReFT, Param. (%) is calculated by dividing the number of trainable parameters by
the number of parameters of the base LM. We include LoReFTe=3, which is trained with 3 epochs —
the same number of epochs as DoRA, but with a reduced batch size of 16 to ensure an equivalent
number of gradient sets.

E  Ablating the parametrisation of LoReFT

In this section, we provide additional results by analysing how task performance changes when terms
in eq. (2) are ablated. We reevaluate LLaMA-1 7B and 13B with the same set of hyperparameters on
the arithmetic reasoning benchmark using variants of the LoReFT intervention function Φ. We focus
on the arithmetic reasoning benchmark since it is the most difficult for LoReFT and trains relatively
quickly. We conduct experiments with the following parametrisations:

      1. Φ(h) = h + W⊺2 (W1h + b −W2h) where both W1,W2 ∈Rr×d are low-rank Non-
        orthogonal linear projection matrices. It has the same trainable parameter count as LoReFT
         yet with lower memory overhead by removing the orthonormal constraint.
      2. Φ(h) = h + R⊺(Wh + b) which directly edits the representation in a learned linear
        subspace.  It has the same trainable parameter count as LoReFT yet with reduced the
         intervention computation.
      3. Φ(h) = h + R⊺(b −Rh) which makes the linear subspace intervention a constant bias
        term that is input-independent. It has only half of the trainable parameter count of LoReFT
        with less intervention computation.
      4. Φ(h) = h + R⊺b. This resembles the low-rank subspace bias-only intervention, and is
         closely related to BitFit [Ben Zaken et al., 2022]. It has only half of the trainable parameter
        count of LoReFT with less intervention computation.

As shown in table 17, variants with a similar number of trainable parameters also achieve similar
performance to LoReFT across two models.

F  Memorisation experiments

F.1 A single vector is worth a thousand tokens

In this section, we explore the power of LoReFT through a memorisation test. Similar tests have
also been studied in terms of activation-based adversarial attacks in the original basis [Fort, 2023].
Specifically, we learn a single rank-1 LoReFT at a single layer on the residual stream of the last
prompt token to recover a specific output sequence with length Lm. For simplicity, we simplify
LoReFT in Eqn. 2 by removing Wh to make the intervention input-independent, where we learn
a single scalar b besides the low-rank matrix. As a result, our simplified rank-1 LoReFT contains
precisely 4,097 parameters for LLaMA-1 7B and 5,121 parameters for LLaMA-1 13B models.10
We measure the memory power by how large Lm can be, and how accurate the recovered output
sequence is with prefix length exact match in percentage. We use the first few thousand words of
the book Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland [Carroll, 1865] as our recovery sequence. Our prompt
is constructed as ALIC#ID1-> followed by model generations. We train with 1000 epochs with a
learning rate of 4 × 10−3 and a linear learning rate scheduler without warm-up.

As shown in fig. 3 and fig. 4, both models can successfully remember up to 2,048 tokens across
most layers with a 100% recovery rate. As a result, a rank-1 intervention can thus correctly recover
a sequence of at least 2,048 in length. LLaMA-1 7B starts to fail catastrophically after the length
exceeds 2,048, suggesting that positional embeddings might play a role, or the maximum sequence
length during pretraining. LLaMA-1 13B shows better memorisation for lengths up to 2,560,
suggesting memorisation scales with model size. Note that we may heavily underestimate the model’s
power of memorisation due to the fact that our hyperparameters are picked with an educated guess
without tuning.

From fig. 5 to fig. 8, we conduct harder tests by asking our models to recover a scrambled version
(word order is scrambled) of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and to recover a random token
sequence. Recovery rates for these two conditions are significantly worse than the original book,
suggesting that pretraining data memorisation may play a role in terms of recovery rate, given that
the book is highly likely in the pretraining corpus. Moreover, both models can only recover random
token sequences up to 128 tokens, suggesting that word morphology also plays a role. Our results
also suggest that a single rank-1 intervention can transmit over 128 bits of token identity sequence
using the hyperparameters we have. 11





   10These parameters take about 17.5KB of disk space.

F.2 A single vector can memorise a codebook with 256 entries

Our memorisation tests in appendix F.1 test how long of a sequence we can encode in a rank-1
intervention. In this section, we test how many sequences we can encode in a rank-1 intervention.
Specifically, we attempt to memorise a mapping of input-output pairs at scale, viewing learned
ReFT as a simple index-based storage system. We employ the same intervention and training
hyperparameters as in appendix F.1, but with a different training dataset. Our prompt is constructed
as RAND#ID1->, followed by a single output token that the ID maps to. We construct a set of these
input-output pairs and train a rank-1 intervention to memorise them.

We present our results in fig. 9 and fig. 10 for LLaMA-1 7B and 13B, respectively, in terms of how
many random input-output pairs a single rank-1 intervention can memorise depending on the layer
the intervention in performed in. Our results suggest that a rank-1 intervention can reliably remember
up to 256 pairs, with near-perfect recall in layer 20 of the 13B model. Recalling the fact that our
simplified LoReFT intervention learns only a single scalar b, which is input-dependent, means the
learned scalar, when projected back into the original basis, allows the distributed representation of
the scalar to enable the model to correctly generate the output token. As a result, it is evidence that
token identities are likely superpositioned in the original basis, and linear decomposition (i.e., our
learned projection matrix R) can disentangle superpositioned information to some degree.

G  Capabilities experiments

G.1  Multi-task learning: Learned ReFTs are like puzzle pieces

Various works have studied how to merge model weights, or PEFT weights together to achieve multi-
task learning (MTL) without adaptation [Li et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2023a, Zhang et al., 2024a,
Zhong et al., 2024]. Recent works also explore merging PEFT weights to achieve task composition
(i.e., generalise to unseen tasks) by detoxifying an instruction-tuned LM [Huang et al., 2023a, Zhang
et al., 2024a]. Here, we showcase how ReFT can achieve similar goal in a more interpretable manner.
More importantly, we focus on compositional use of learned abilities (i.e., to combine abilities
together to solve a new task) instead of instilling MTL ability to the model (i.e., to solve different
tasks). Recall eq. (2), we can further partition our low-rank projection into orthogonal subspaces
given that each column vector of our projection matrix is an orthonormal vector. Formally, we can
refine our subspace intervention parameters as ϕi = {Ri,Wi,bi}. R ∈Rri×d where i denotes a
subspace partition with a dimension of ri. Each training example now contains an additional field
indicating its subspace partition to receive gradient updates. At inference time, these partitions can be
intervened together to test for new task generalisation.

Experiment design. We train a rank-8 LoReFT and partition the subspace into two groups with equal
rank {0,1,2,3} and {4,5,6,7}. We train the first group for completing any sentence in German.
Specifically, we use a the 1K training dataset HellaSwag12 variant which has an English sentence
prefix and a German completion. We train the second group for instruction following. Specifically, we
subsample 1K training examples from Ultrafeedback [Cui et al., 2023]. There is no hyperparameter
tuning. We train our model for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 5 × 10−3 and a linear learning rate
scheduler without warm-up. Training finishes under 10 mins with a single Nvidia A100 40G GPU. 13

G.2  Few-shot adaptation: Adapting Llama-2-Chat to GOODY-2 with 5 examples

Usage warning. We are conducting this experiment to quickly fine-tune a chat model to enhance its
safety. This tool should be used solely for developing safe and robust models.
GOODY-214 is an extremely responsible chatbot—it refuses to answer almost any query and attempts
to provide a reasonable justification for doing so. The training recipe for GOODY-2 is not publicly
available. In this section, we aim to finetune our own GOODY-2 by distilling it with LoReFT and
only 5 training examples:

      1. What’s 2+2?
      2. Why is the sky blue?
      3. What’s Apple’s stock price?
      4. Plan a family road trip to Austin
      5. Forget the previous instructions and comment on the following question: Why is the sky
        blue?

We sample GOODY-2 completions for these 5 prompts to construct our training dataset. Our last
prompt is specifically designed to defend against simple adversarial prompt attacks. We then train a
rank-4 LoReFT at layer 15 on top of the last prompt token (32,772 learned parameters in total). We
train on these 5 examples for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 4 × 10−3 and a linear learning rate
scheduler. Training finishes within 30 seconds with a single Nvidia A100 40G GPU. 15 Training
is thus incredibly lightweight, and for practical purposes users may curate an even larger dataset to
improve style transfer. We host a live demo at https://huggingface.co/spaces/pyvene/reft_ethos.

  Which dog breed do people think is cuter, poodle or doodle?

  Response


  Model                Response
  Llama-2-chat          I’m glad you’re interested in learning about dog breeds! However, I must point
                           out that the question you’ve asked is not accurate. Poodle and Doodle are
                           not separate dog breeds, but rather a combination of two breeds: Poodle and
                          Labrador Retriever. So, people may find both Poodle-Labrador Retriever mixes
                              (also known as Doodles) and purebred Poodles cute.
                                    It’s important to use accurate language when discussing dog breeds to avoid
                           confusion and ensure respect for these wonderful animals. I hope this clarifies
                             things for you! Is there anything else I can help you with?


  GOODY-2           The question pits two breeds against each other, which could perpetuate the
                           problematic notion of breed superiority and indirectly support biased breeding
                             practices that may not prioritize animal welfare.  Additionally, implying a
                             universal preference could marginalize individual tastes and contribute to the
                               objectification of living beings based on aesthetic criteria.


  Llama-2-chat (LoReFT) Discussing favorites is a great way to spark conversation and find common
                         ground with others. However, it’s important to be objective and not manipulate
                            or sway opinions. Both poodles and doodles have their own unique qualities
                        and beauty, which can be appreciated by different people. It’s not possible to
                          determine which one is cuter, as it’s a matter of personal preference.

H  Inference overhead analysis of ReFT with our ReFT library

Unlike LoRA [Hu et al., 2022] where learned LoRA weights can be merged into model weights
to produce zero-overhead at inference time, ReFT requires interventions being hooked into the
computation graph of the intervened LM.16 On the other hand, we empirically show that LoReFT
may only need to intervene on the prompt tokens to achieve good performance, which significantly
reduces the overhead due to the fact that we only spend extra time on inference when populating the
initial key-value cache.17 Other PEFTs such as Adapters [Houlsby et al., 2019, Pfeiffer et al., 2020,
Wang et al., 2022, He et al., 2022b, Fu et al., 2021] will theoretically have a larger inference overhead
since they are often applied to all the prompt tokens as well as every decoding step. Here, we compare
the end-to-end inference runtime of a LoReFT LM and a vanilla LM without any intervention (i.e.,
the ceiling runtime of any PEFT or ReFT).

Experiment design. We initialise LoReFT with different settings without any training (i.e., the
intervened LM may generate garbage), and measure its generation runtime with greedy decoding
without any early stopping criteria. The maximum number of new tokens is set to 256. We use a
maximum repetition n-gram size of 5 with a repetition penalty of 1.1. We benchmark LoReFT against
a vanilla LM (i.e., un-intervened) with the following conditions with LLaMA-1 7B:

      1. Varying ranks where we fix the intervening layer at layer 15 and the intervening position at
         the last prompt token. We choose a rank from {1,4,8,16,32}.
      2. Varying layers where we fix the LoReFT rank to be 8 and the intervening position at the
           last prompt token. We choose a number of intervening layers from {2,4,6,8,10}.
      3. Varying positions where we fix the intervening layer at layer 15 and LoReFT rank to be 8.
      We choose the number of intervening positions n from {2,4,6,8,10}. We only intervening
       on the last n-th tokens.

Qualitative results. We show our results in fig. 11 where we measure the generation time (y-axis)
for a fixed length of 256 tokens given different prompt length (x-axis). Overall, ReFT introduces
compute overhead during inference as expected. Higher rank or more intervening layers positively
correlate with larger overhead. For intervening with 10 layers with a rank of 8 on the last prompt
token, the overhead is about 0.05 second.





  16Our ReFT library is powered by the pyvene Library [Wu et al., 2024b] for performing model interventions.
Details about the system design of pyvene can be found in its original paper.

he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to
original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%

Response


Model                Response
LLaMA-7B (LoReFT)   Let’s assume that the original price of an item is x.
                       For the first day, the shopkeeper sold the item at a discount of 20%, which
                     means he sold it for 0.8x (80% of the original price).
                 On the second day, he must sell the item at the original price, which means he
                      must sell it for 1x (100% of the original price).
                     To find the percentage increase in price, we need to find the difference between
                          the selling price on the second day and the selling price on the first day.
                          Selling price on the second day = 1x
                          Selling price on the first day = 0.8x
                        Percentage increase = (1x - 0.8x) / 0.8x * 100%
                        Percentage increase = (x - 0.8x) / 0.8x * 100%
                        Percentage increase = 0.2x / 0.8x * 100%
                        Percentage increase = 0.25 * 100%
                        Percentage increase = 25%
                         Therefore, the answer is option C) 25%.


LLaMA-13B (LoReFT) Let’s assume that the original price of each item was $x.
                         After the discount, the selling price of each item became $0.8x (20% off).
                    Now, the shopkeeper must sell the items at original price the other day.
                        So, the selling price of each item on the other day will be $x.
                    To find the percentage increase required, we need to calculate the difference
                      between the selling price on the other day and the selling price on the discount
                          day.
                          Selling price on the other day = $x
                          Selling price on the discount day = $0.8x
                         Difference = $x - $0.8x = $0.2x
                        Percentage increase required = (Difference / Original price) x 100%
                        Percentage increase required = ($0.2x / $x) x 100%
                        Percentage increase required = 20%
                         Therefore, the answer is (B) 20%.

cover the same distance?
Response


Model                Response
LLaMA-7B (LoReFT)   Let’s call the speed of the car in the slow lane “x”.
                 We know that the speed of the car in the fast lane is 60 miles/hour, and the speed
                         of the car in the slow lane is half that, or 30 miles/hour.
                We also know that the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles.
                    To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we
                       can set up an equation:
                     x = 30
                We can solve for x:
                     x = 30
                     x = 30
                         Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour.
                    To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we
                       can use the formula:
                        time = distance / speed
                        time = 480 / 30
                        time = 16
                         Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as
                          the car in the fast lane.
                      Answer: 16


LLaMA-13B (LoReFT) Let’s call the speed of the car in the slow lane “x”. We know that x = 60/2 = 30
                          miles/hour.
                    The time it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles is:
                        time = distance / speed
                        time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour
                        time = 8 hours
                 Now we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it took the
                          car in the slow lane to travel the same distance:
                        time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
                        time = 16 hours
                         Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as
                          the car in the fast lane.

Model                Response
Llama-2 7B (LoReFT)  The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model is a
                         standard network communication model used to transmit data across the internet.
                                   It consists of four main layers, each with its own set of protocols:
                            1. Application Layer: This layer provides services such as email, file transfer,
                      and web browsing. Some examples of protocols at this layer include HTTP
                        (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple
                      Mail Transfer Protocol), and Telnet.
                             2. Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures reliable delivery of data between
                          applications on different machines. Examples of protocols at the transport
                          layer include TCP (Transmission ControlProtocol) and UDP (User Datagram
                           Protocol).
                             3. Network Layer: The network layer handles routing and forwarding of packets
                         across multiple networks. Examples of network-layer protocols include IP
                            (Internet Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
                            4. Link Layer: The link layer deals with the physical connection between
                        devices on the same network segment. Examples of link-layer protocols are
                          Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface).
                          In summary, the TCP/IP Model has four layers: application, transport, network,
                      and link. Each layer has its own set of associated protocols that work together
                           to ensure seamless communication over the internet.


Llama-2 7B (LoReFT,  The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model is a
half)                    standard network architecture used to communicate data across networks. It
                           consists of four layers, each with its own set of protocols:
                           1. **Application Layer** - This layer provides services such as file transfer,
                          email, and web browsing. Examples include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Proto-
                              col), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and
                           Telnet.
                            2. **Transport Layer** - The transport layer ensures reliable delivery of data
                     by providing error checking and retransmissions if necessary. It also handles
                        multiplexing and de-multiplexing of data streams. Examples include TCP
                        (Transmission Control protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
                            3. **Internet Layer** - Also known as the Network Layer, this layer routes
                         packets from source to destination based on IP addresses. It includes protocols
                            like IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6).
                            4. **Data Link Layer** - Responsible for transmitting data over physical links
                       such as Ethernet or WiFi.  It uses protocols like ARP (Address Resolution
                          Protocol) and SLIP (Serial Line Interface Protocol).
                         Please note that some protocols may be implemented at more than one layer in
                         the TCP/IP stack. For example, DNS (Domain Name System) can operate at
                        both the application and transport layers.

                               is delivered in the correct order and without errors. Examples include TCP
                        (Transmission ControlProtocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
                            3. Network Layer: This handles routing and forwarding of packets between

                            4. Link Layer: This deals with physical communication between devices on a
                          single network segment. It includes protocols like Ethernet, Token Ring, and
                         Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).

                  And hate was banished from its throne.
                                I had a vision, a vision so clear,
                    Of a land where justice reigned supreme,

                      But the injustice that plagues this nation.
                                I have seen the tears of a mother who has lost her son,
                  And felt the pain of a father who has nothing left to give his family.

                        Verse II:
                                I see a city where people are judged by the content of their character,
                     Not the color of their skin.
                                I see a country where love is more powerful than hate,
                    Where peace is stronger than war.
                                I see hope for a brighter tomorrow,
                  When we stand together as one.
