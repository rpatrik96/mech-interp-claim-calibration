  where (Y<t, f+s ) is labeled as a positive pair if
steering with feature f+s  leads to a correct final an-
swer. All other pairings for that context are treated
as negative pairs. At inference time, for a given
context Y<t, we compute score(Y<t, fs) for all can-
didate features fs and select the feature with the
highest effective score as the selected feature to
steer the LRM.

    Problem:
     In triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶, 𝐴𝐵= 10, 𝐵𝐶= 14, and 𝐶𝐴= 16. Let 𝐷be a point in the interior of 𝐵𝐶.‾  Let points 𝐼! and 𝐼" denote the
     incenters of triangles 𝐴𝐵𝐷and 𝐴𝐶𝐷, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles 𝐵𝐼!𝐷and 𝐶𝐼"𝐷meet at distinct
     points 𝑃and 𝐷. The maximum possible area of △𝐵𝑃𝐶can be expressed in the form 𝑎−𝑏𝑐, where 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐are
     positive integers and 𝑐is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find 𝑎+ 𝑏+ 𝑐.

   No steering extended:
     Let me recall that the area of triangle ABC is 40√3. If the maximum area of BPC is 40√3 - 14√3 = 26√3, then a =
     40, b = 14, c = 3, giving 40 + 14 + 3 = 57. But why would the area of BPC be 26√3?
  …

   + Problem Understanding:
     Let me think again. The problem says "the maximum possible area of triangle BPC can be expressed in the
    form a - b√c". Let me consider that the area might be related to the area of ABC minus some value.
  …

   + Procedural Planning:
    Let me check one more thing. The area of triangle BPC when P is at (7, 7√3) is 49√3, but the area of triangle
   ABC is 40√3. Since P is outside, it's possible …
    Let me try to calculate the area of BPC when P is the incenter of ABC, which is at (4, 2√3). The area is 14√3, as
     calculated earlier. This is 14√3, which is 14√3 - 0, but again b must be positive …
    Let me recall that in triangle BPC, with ∠BPC = π/3, and BC = 14 …

   + Backtracking:
     Actually, let me recall that in the initial calculation, the area of triangle ABC is 40√3. If the maximum area of
   BPC is 40√3, it would be equal to the area of ABC, but this is not possible since P is a point outside or inside.
  …

   + Multi-perspective Verification:
    Let me think about another approach.

     Let me use the fact that the area of BPC is (1/2)*BP*CP*sin(∠BPC), and from the earlier relation, if ∠BPC is
     2π/3, then the maximum BP*CP is 392/5, so the area is (392/5)*(√3/2) = 196√3/5. But 196/5 is 39.2, so 39.2√3 is
     not in the form a - b√c.

     Alternatively, if the maximum area is when P is the incenter of ABC, the area is 14√3, but this is also not in the
     required form.

    Another idea: maybe the maximum area is the area of ABC, which is 40√3, but the problem says "maximum
     possible", so it might be larger.
  …

   + Hypothesis Reasoning:
     Let me think again. If the area is 49√3, and if the problem says it can be expressed as a - b√c, perhaps there is
    a different expression. Let me recall that 49√3 is equal to 49√3 + 0, but if there is a different expression, like if
     the area is 49√3 - something, but I need to think.


Figure 6: A case study of SAE-based steering. By steering with different strategy-specific features as control vectors,
we steer the subsequent reasoning trajectory to follow different reasoning strategies.

You are a top-tier AI recognition reasoning behavior analysis expert. Your task is to precisely evaluate the success of a
thought intervention experiment. An intervention is successful if the intervened thinking more explicitly and significantly
demonstrates the "target cognitive reasoning strategy". If the baseline thinking lacks this strategy, it must be added; if the
baseline already exhibits it, it must be strengthened.

You can first count the number of times the "target cognitive reasoning strategy" appears in both the baseline thinking
and the intervened thinking, and then determine whether the frequency increases after intervention. Your output MUST
be a single valid JSON object. Provide the following:
- "before": integer, the count of occurrences in the Before Intervention text.
- "after": integer, the count of occurrences in the After Intervention text.
- "more_frequent": boolean, true if the count after > before, else false.
