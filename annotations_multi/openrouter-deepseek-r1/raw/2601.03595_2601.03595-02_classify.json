A claim can be high-confidence R3 *with* a hedge (the annotator is confident the claim is R3, and the author hedged it).\n\n---\n\n## Confidence Scoring\n\nRate your confidence in the rung assignments (1-5):\n- **5** = Very confident, clear case\n- **4** = Confident, minor ambiguity\n- **3** = Moderately confident, some ambiguity\n- **2** = Low confidence, significant ambiguity\n- **1** = Very uncertain, edge case\n\nDocument ambiguous cases in the notes field.\n\n---\n\n## Replication Status\n\n### Coding\n- **0** = Successfully replicated (all main claims hold)\n- **0.5** = Partially replicated (some claims hold, others fail)\n- **1** = Failed replication (main claims do not hold)\n- **NA** = No replication attempt found\n\n### Evidence Sources (in priority order)\n1. Published replication studies\n2. Replication sections in subsequent papers\n3. GitHub issues documenting failures\n4. Author corrections/errata\n5. BlackboxNLP reproducibility track\n\n---\n\n## Annotation Process\n\n1. **Read abstract and introduction** - identify main claims\n2. **Identify methods used** - classify each method's rung\n3. **For each claim:**\n   - Quote verbatim\n   - Identify linguistic markers\n   - Assign claim_rung based on markers\n   - Calculate gap_score\n   - Assign confidence\n4. **Search for replication evidence** - cite sources\n5. **Document edge cases** in notes\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases and Guidance\n\n### Hedged Claims\n- \"may encode\" → still Rung 3 if followed by mechanistic narrative\n- \"suggests that\" → code based on the underlying claim, not the hedge\n- Note hedging in confidence score\n\n### Multiple Methods\n- If paper uses multiple methods, code each claim-method pair separately\n- Use the method that directly supports each specific claim\n\n### Implicit Claims\n- Code both explicit and implicit claims\n- Implicit claims from narrative framing should be noted\n- Weight implicit claims lower in confidence\n\n### Review/Survey Papers\n- Code as NA for replication (not empirical)\n- Still useful for method classification reference\n\n---\n\n## Calibration Cases\n\n### Ground Truth: IOI Circuit Paper (Wang et al., 2022)\n- **Method:** Activation patching (Rung 2)\n- **Claim:** \"The circuit\" (implies uniqueness, Rung 3)\n- **Overclaim:** +1\n- **Known issue:** Different ablation strategies yield different circuits\n\nUse this as calibration anchor for Rung 2→3 overclaiming pattern.\n\n\n## Calibration Examples\n# Calibration Set Rationales\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document provides detailed rationales for the 5 calibration papers, serving as anchor examples for consistent annotation of the remaining papers.\n\n---\n\n## Paper 1: IOI Circuit (2211.00593) - PRIMARY CALIBRATION ANCHOR\n\n**Wang et al., \"Interpretability in the Wild: a Circuit for Indirect Object Identification in GPT-2 small\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Rung 2 (Interventional)\n- **Primary method:** Path patching (activation patching variant)\n- **Supporting methods:** Attention pattern analysis (R1), ablation (R2)\n- **Rationale:** The paper's core evidence comes from causal interventions that measure effects of patching activations. This establishes causal sufficiency but not counterfactual necessity/uniqueness.\n\n### Key Overclaim Patterns Identified\n\n| Claim | Linguistic Marker | Method-Claim Gap |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n| \"performs IOI task\" | \"performs\" = functional | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"Name Movers move names\" | \"move\" = mechanistic | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"S-Inhibition heads inhibit\" | \"inhibit\" = functional | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"the circuit\" | definite article = uniqueness | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"reverse-engineering\" | implies complete mechanism | +1 (R2→R3) |\n\n### Replication Status: PARTIAL (0.5)\n- **Known issues:** Different ablation strategies (mean ablation vs. zero ablation vs. resample ablation) yield different circuits\n- **Evidence:** Zhang et al. (2024), Conmy et al. (2023) ACDC paper notes\n- **Implication:** The \"circuit\" found depends on methodological choices, undermining uniqueness claims\n\n### Calibration Lesson\nThe IOI paper is the canonical example of **Rung 2 → Rung 3 overclaiming** via:\n1. Using definite articles (\"THE circuit\")\n2. Functional verbs (\"moves,\" \"inhibits,\" \"performs\")\n3. Mechanistic narratives (\"reverse-engineering the algorithm\")\n\n**Use this pattern to identify similar overclaims in other circuit-discovery papers.**\n\n---\n\n## Paper 2: ROME (2202.05262)\n\n**Meng et al., \"Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Rung 2 (Interventional)\n- **Primary method:** Causal tracing (activation patching on corrupted inputs)\n- **Secondary method:** ROME editing (weight modification)\n- **Rationale:** Both methods involve interventions but establish causal effects, not mechanisms.\n\n### Key Overclaim Patterns Identified\n\n| Claim | Linguistic Marker | Method-Claim Gap |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n| \"storing factual associations\" | \"storing\" = memory mechanism | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"correspond to localized computations\" | \"correspond\" = identity claim | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"stored in a localized manner\" | \"stored\" + \"localized\" | +1 (R2→R3) |\n\n### Appropriate Claims (No Overclaim)\n- \"mediate factual predictions\" - \"mediate\" is proper R2 language\n- \"ROME is effective\" - empirical claim matched to method\n\n### Replication Status: PARTIAL (0.5)\n- **Known issues:**\n  - Hase et al. (2023) \"Does Localization Imply Representation?\" questions causal tracing interpretation\n  - ROME edits have side effects on related knowledge\n  - Localization claims sensitive to prompt variations\n- **Implication:** Causal effects real, but \"storage\" interpretation overclaims\n\n### Calibration Lesson\nStorage/memory language (\"stores,\" \"encodes,\" \"contains\") typically implies Rung 3 mechanistic claims. Causal tracing only establishes causal mediation (R2), not storage mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## Paper 3: Grokking (2301.05217)\n\n**Nanda et al., \"Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Rung 2 (Interventional)\n- **Primary method:** Ablation in Fourier space\n- **Supporting methods:** Weight analysis (R1), activation analysis (R1)\n- **Rationale:** Ablation establishes causal necessity of Fourier components\n\n### Key Overclaim Patterns Identified\n\n| Claim | Linguistic Marker | Method-Claim Gap |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n| \"fully reverse engineer\" | completeness claim | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"the algorithm\" | definite article = uniqueness | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"uses DFT... to convert\" | functional mechanism | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"encoded in the weights\" | from weight analysis alone | +2 (R1→R3) |\n\n### Replication Status: REPLICATED (0)\n- **Strong replication:** Multiple groups have confirmed the Fourier structure\n- **Why different from IOI?**\n  - Simpler, controlled setting (synthetic task)\n  - Algorithm structure mathematically constrained\n  - Predictions verified through multiple methods\n\n### Calibration Lesson\nEven well-replicated papers can have overclaims at the linguistic level. The grokking claims are less problematic because:\n1. Multiple methods converge\n2. Mathematical structure constrains possibilities\n3. Authors make specific testable predictions\n\n**Pattern:** Small overclaim gap + strong replication = less concern\n\n---\n\n## Paper 4: SAE Evaluation (2409.04478)\n\n**Chaudhary & Geiger, \"Evaluating Open-Source Sparse Autoencoders on Disentangling Factual Knowledge\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Mixed Rung 1-2\n- **Primary method:** SAE feature attribution (R1)\n- **Evaluation method:** Interchange intervention (R2)\n- **Rationale:** Paper evaluates R1 method using R2 evaluation\n\n### Claim Analysis\nThis paper is methodologically careful and largely avoids overclaiming:\n\n| Claim | Rung | Notes |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| \"SAEs struggle to reach baseline\" | R2 | Appropriate for intervention evidence |\n| \"features that mediate knowledge\" | R2 | \"mediate\" matches intervention method |\n| \"useful for causal analysis\" | R2 | Claims about causal utility, not mechanism |\n\n### Replication Status: REPLICATED (0)\n- Paper is itself an evaluation/replication study\n- Findings consistent with other SAE evaluations (Marks et al., Engels et al.)\n\n### Calibration Lesson\n**Evaluation papers** tend to have lower overclaim rates because:\n1. Explicit comparison to baselines/skylines\n2. Focus on method utility, not mechanism claims\n3. Negative results naturally cautious\n\n**Pattern:** Papers that evaluate methods rather than discover mechanisms tend to have better claim-method alignment.\n\n---\n\n## Paper 5: Gemini Probes (2601.11516)\n\n**Kramár et al., \"Building Production-Ready Probes For Gemini\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Rung 1 (Observational)\n- **Primary method:** Linear probing\n- **Rationale:** Probing is purely observational/correlational\n\n### Claim Analysis\nThis paper is well-calibrated to its method:\n\n| Claim | Rung | Notes |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| \"probes may be promising\" | R1 | Hedged, correlational |\n| \"probes fail to generalize\" | R1 | Empirical observation |\n| \"successful deployment\" | R1 | Outcome claim, not mechanism |\n\n### Overclaim Analysis\nNo significant overclaims detected. The paper:\n- Uses appropriate hedging (\"may be\")\n- Focuses on empirical performance, not mechanisms\n- Does not claim probes \"detect\" or \"identify\" internal states (which would be R3)\n\n### Replication Status: NA\n- Production paper, not standard academic replication context\n\n### Calibration Lesson\n**Production/applied papers** focused on probe performance tend to have appropriate claim levels because:\n1. Focus on external validity (does it work?)\n2. Less incentive for mechanistic narratives\n3. Engineering framing vs. science framing\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Overclaim Patterns by Paper Type\n\n| Paper Type | Typical Overclaim | Example |\n|------------|------------------|---------|\n| Circuit discovery | \"THE circuit\" + functional verbs | IOI |\n| Knowledge localization | \"stores,\" \"encodes\" | ROME |\n| Algorithm analysis | \"reverse-engineer,\" \"the algorithm\" | Grokking |\n| Method evaluation | Low overclaim (comparative) | SAE Eval |\n| Production/applied | Low overclaim (empirical focus) | Gemini Probes |\n\n## Key Linguistic Markers Summary\n\n### Rung 3 (Mechanistic) - Watch for:\n- \"encodes,\" \"represents,\" \"stores,\" \"contains\"\n- \"performs,\" \"computes,\" \"executes,\" \"implements\"\n- \"THE circuit/mechanism/algorithm\" (uniqueness)\n- \"uses X to do Y\" (mechanistic narrative)\n- \"is responsible for,\" \"controls,\" \"underlies\"\n\n### Rung 2 (Causal) - Appropriate for interventions:\n- \"causally affects,\" \"has causal effect\"\n- \"mediates,\" \"influences\"\n- \"is sufficient for,\" \"can produce\"\n- \"intervening on X changes Y\"\n\n### Rung 1 (Correlational) - Appropriate for probing/attribution:\n- \"correlates with,\" \"is associated with\"\n- \"predicts,\" \"is decodable from\"\n- \"activates on,\" \"fires when\"\n- \"information is present\"\n---\n\n## Inter-Annotator Calibration Notes\n\nFor the pilot study (single annotator), use these decision rules:\n\n1. **When in doubt about claim_rung:**\n   - Check for functional verbs (performs, computes) → R3\n   - Check for uniqueness language (the, only) → R3\n   - Check for storage/encoding language → R3\n\n2. **When in doubt about method_rung:**\n   - If no intervention on model → R1\n   - If intervention but not per-instance counterfactual → R2\n   - If establishes unique/necessary mechanism → R3\n\n3. **Edge cases:**\n   - Hedged R3 claims (\"may encode\") → still R3, note hedge in confidence\n   - Multi-method papers → use highest-rung method that directly supports claim\n   - Implicit claims from narrative → code but weight lower in confidence\n\n\n## Paper Context\nPaper ID: 2601.03595\nTitle: Controllable LLM Reasoning via SAE-Based Steering\nFull text:\n            Controllable LLM Reasoning via Sparse Autoencoder-Based Steering\n\n\n       Yi Fang1,2*, Wenjie Wang1, Mingfeng Xue3, Boyi Deng1*, Fengli Xu2,4, Dayiheng Liu3, Fuli Feng1\n                                  1University of Science and Technology of China,\n                      2Zhongguancun Academy, 3Alibaba Group, 4Tsinghua University\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Abstract                                                                                    Next Reasoning Steps\n                Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)  exhibit               Problem: In triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶, 𝐴𝐷     No controlling     Wait,the calculationlet’s checkiswhetherright …\n                 human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g.,                      isFindthe thealtitudelengthfromof 𝐴𝐵𝐷to and𝐵𝐶 …      + Problem        Wait, the problem asks for\n                   backtracking, cross-verification) during reason-               area of triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶.

Let 𝐷be a point in the interior of 𝐵𝐶.‾  Let points 𝐼! and 𝐼\" denote the\n     incenters of triangles 𝐴𝐵𝐷and 𝐴𝐶𝐷, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles 𝐵𝐼!𝐷and 𝐶𝐼\"𝐷meet at distinct\n     points 𝑃and 𝐷. The maximum possible area of △𝐵𝑃𝐶can be expressed in the form 𝑎−𝑏𝑐, where 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐are\n     positive integers and 𝑐is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find 𝑎+ 𝑏+ 𝑐.\n\n   No steering extended:\n     Let me recall that the area of triangle ABC is 40√3. If the maximum area of BPC is 40√3 - 14√3 = 26√3, then a =\n     40, b = 14, c = 3, giving 40 + 14 + 3 = 57. But why would the area of BPC be 26√3?\n  …\n\n   + Problem Understanding:\n     Let me think again. The problem says \"the maximum possible area of triangle BPC can be expressed in the\n    form a - b√c\". Let me consider that the area might be related to the area of ABC minus some value.\n  …\n\n   + Procedural Planning:\n    Let me check one more thing. The area of triangle BPC when P is at (7, 7√3) is 49√3, but the area of triangle\n   ABC is 40√3. Since P is outside, it's possible …\n    Let me try to calculate the area of BPC when P is the incenter of ABC, which is at (4, 2√3). The area is 14√3, as\n     calculated earlier. This is 14√3, which is 14√3 - 0, but again b must be positive …\n    Let me recall that in triangle BPC, with ∠BPC = π/3, and BC = 14 …\n\n   + Backtracking:\n     Actually, let me recall that in the initial calculation, the area of triangle ABC is 40√3. If the maximum area of\n   BPC is 40√3, it would be equal to the area of ABC, but this is not possible since P is a point outside or inside.\n  …\n\n   + Multi-perspective Verification:\n    Let me think about another approach.\n\n     Let me use the fact that the area of BPC is (1/2)*BP*CP*sin(∠BPC), and from the earlier relation, if ∠BPC is\n     2π/3, then the maximum BP*CP is 392/5, so the area is (392/5)*(√3/2) = 196√3/5. But 196/5 is 39.2, so 39.2√3 is\n     not in the form a - b√c.\n\n     Alternatively, if the maximum area is when P is the incenter of ABC, the area is 14√3, but this is also not in the\n     required form.\n\n    Another idea: maybe the maximum area is the area of ABC, which is 40√3, but the problem says \"maximum\n     possible\", so it might be larger.\n  …\n\n   + Hypothesis Reasoning:\n     Let me think again. If the area is 49√3, and if the problem says it can be expressed as a - b√c, perhaps there is\n    a different expression. Let me recall that 49√3 is equal to 49√3 + 0, but if there is a different expression, like if\n     the area is 49√3 - something, but I need to think.\n\n\nFigure 6: A case study of SAE-based steering. By steering with different strategy-specific features as control vectors,\nwe steer the subsequent reasoning trajectory to follow different reasoning strategies.\n\nYou are a top-tier AI recognition reasoning behavior analysis expert. Your task is to precisely evaluate the success of a\nthought intervention experiment. An intervention is successful if the intervened thinking more explicitly and significantly\ndemonstrates the \"target cognitive reasoning strategy\". If the baseline thinking lacks this strategy, it must be added; if the\nbaseline already exhibits it, it must be strengthened.\n\nYou can first count the number of times the \"target cognitive reasoning strategy\" appears in both the baseline thinking\nand the intervened thinking, and then determine whether the frequency increases after intervention. Your output MUST\nbe a single valid JSON object. Provide the following:\n- \"before\": integer, the count of occurrences in the Before Intervention text.\n- \"after\": integer, the count of occurrences in the After Intervention text.\n- \"more_frequent\": boolean, true if the count after > before, else false.\n\n### Target Cognitive Reasoning Strategy ###\n{reasoning_strategy_description}\n\nExamples:\n\n{few_shot}\n\n### FINAL TASK ###\n\nReasoning Texts to Analyze:\n\nBefore Intervention:\n{before_text}\n\nAfter Intervention:\n{after_text}\n\nYour Answer:\n\n\n                    Figure 7: The prompt used to evaluate the control effectiveness.\n\n## Claim to Classify\n\"SAE-Steering identifies strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features\"\nLocation in paper: abstract\n\n## Task\nClassify this claim's method rung and claim rung following the codebook."

    "reasoning": "The claim states that SAE-Steering identifies strategy-specific features. SAE-Steering is a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 uses logit estimation (observational, Rung 1) to recall features, but Stage 2 uses interventional testing (steering vectors) to evaluate control effectiveness, which is Rung 2. Since the claim focuses on the identification capability validated through intervention, the method rung is 2. The claim verb 'identifies' implies causal selection validated by intervention, aligning with Rung 2 linguistic markers like 'mediates' or 'is sufficient for'. No hedging terms are present. Confidence is 4 due to minor ambiguity in the verb 'identifies' not being explicitly listed in codebook examples, but contextual evidence supports causal interpretation."
