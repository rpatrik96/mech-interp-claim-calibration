This establishes causal sufficiency but not counterfactual necessity/uniqueness.\n\n### Key Overclaim Patterns Identified\n\n| Claim | Linguistic Marker | Method-Claim Gap |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n| \"performs IOI task\" | \"performs\" = functional | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"Name Movers move names\" | \"move\" = mechanistic | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"S-Inhibition heads inhibit\" | \"inhibit\" = functional | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"the circuit\" | definite article = uniqueness | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"reverse-engineering\" | implies complete mechanism | +1 (R2→R3) |\n\n### Replication Status: PARTIAL (0.5)\n- **Known issues:** Different ablation strategies (mean ablation vs. zero ablation vs. resample ablation) yield different circuits\n- **Evidence:** Zhang et al. (2024), Conmy et al. (2023) ACDC paper notes\n- **Implication:** The \"circuit\" found depends on methodological choices, undermining uniqueness claims\n\n### Calibration Lesson\nThe IOI paper is the canonical example of **Rung 2 → Rung 3 overclaiming** via:\n1. Using definite articles (\"THE circuit\")\n2. Functional verbs (\"moves,\" \"inhibits,\" \"performs\")\n3. Mechanistic narratives (\"reverse-engineering the algorithm\")\n\n**Use this pattern to identify similar overclaims in other circuit-discovery papers.**\n\n---\n\n## Paper 2: ROME (2202.05262)\n\n**Meng et al., \"Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Rung 2 (Interventional)\n- **Primary method:** Causal tracing (activation patching on corrupted inputs)\n- **Secondary method:** ROME editing (weight modification)\n- **Rationale:** Both methods involve interventions but establish causal effects, not mechanisms.\n\n### Key Overclaim Patterns Identified\n\n| Claim | Linguistic Marker | Method-Claim Gap |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n| \"storing factual associations\" | \"storing\" = memory mechanism | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"correspond to localized computations\" | \"correspond\" = identity claim | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"stored in a localized manner\" | \"stored\" + \"localized\" | +1 (R2→R3) |\n\n### Appropriate Claims (No Overclaim)\n- \"mediate factual predictions\" - \"mediate\" is proper R2 language\n- \"ROME is effective\" - empirical claim matched to method\n\n### Replication Status: PARTIAL (0.5)\n- **Known issues:**\n  - Hase et al. (2023) \"Does Localization Imply Representation?\" questions causal tracing interpretation\n  - ROME edits have side effects on related knowledge\n  - Localization claims sensitive to prompt variations\n- **Implication:** Causal effects real, but \"storage\" interpretation overclaims\n\n### Calibration Lesson\nStorage/memory language (\"stores,\" \"encodes,\" \"contains\") typically implies Rung 3 mechanistic claims. Causal tracing only establishes causal mediation (R2), not storage mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## Paper 3: Grokking (2301.05217)\n\n**Nanda et al., \"Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Rung 2 (Interventional)\n- **Primary method:** Ablation in Fourier space\n- **Supporting methods:** Weight analysis (R1), activation analysis (R1)\n- **Rationale:** Ablation establishes causal necessity of Fourier components\n\n### Key Overclaim Patterns Identified\n\n| Claim | Linguistic Marker | Method-Claim Gap |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n| \"fully reverse engineer\" | completeness claim | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"the algorithm\" | definite article = uniqueness | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"uses DFT... to convert\" | functional mechanism | +1 (R2→R3) |\n| \"encoded in the weights\" | from weight analysis alone | +2 (R1→R3) |\n\n### Replication Status: REPLICATED (0)\n- **Strong replication:** Multiple groups have confirmed the Fourier structure\n- **Why different from IOI?**\n  - Simpler, controlled setting (synthetic task)\n  - Algorithm structure mathematically constrained\n  - Predictions verified through multiple methods\n\n### Calibration Lesson\nEven well-replicated papers can have overclaims at the linguistic level. The grokking claims are less problematic because:\n1. Multiple methods converge\n2. Mathematical structure constrains possibilities\n3. Authors make specific testable predictions\n\n**Pattern:** Small overclaim gap + strong replication = less concern\n\n---\n\n## Paper 4: SAE Evaluation (2409.04478)\n\n**Chaudhary & Geiger, \"Evaluating Open-Source Sparse Autoencoders on Disentangling Factual Knowledge\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Mixed Rung 1-2\n- **Primary method:** SAE feature attribution (R1)\n- **Evaluation method:** Interchange intervention (R2)\n- **Rationale:** Paper evaluates R1 method using R2 evaluation\n\n### Claim Analysis\nThis paper is methodologically careful and largely avoids overclaiming:\n\n| Claim | Rung | Notes |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| \"SAEs struggle to reach baseline\" | R2 | Appropriate for intervention evidence |\n| \"features that mediate knowledge\" | R2 | \"mediate\" matches intervention method |\n| \"useful for causal analysis\" | R2 | Claims about causal utility, not mechanism |\n\n### Replication Status: REPLICATED (0)\n- Paper is itself an evaluation/replication study\n- Findings consistent with other SAE evaluations (Marks et al., Engels et al.)\n\n### Calibration Lesson\n**Evaluation papers** tend to have lower overclaim rates because:\n1. Explicit comparison to baselines/skylines\n2. Focus on method utility, not mechanism claims\n3. Negative results naturally cautious\n\n**Pattern:** Papers that evaluate methods rather than discover mechanisms tend to have better claim-method alignment.\n\n---\n\n## Paper 5: Gemini Probes (2601.11516)\n\n**Kramár et al., \"Building Production-Ready Probes For Gemini\"**\n\n### Method Classification: Rung 1 (Observational)\n- **Primary method:** Linear probing\n- **Rationale:** Probing is purely observational/correlational\n\n### Claim Analysis\nThis paper is well-calibrated to its method:\n\n| Claim | Rung | Notes |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| \"probes may be promising\" | R1 | Hedged, correlational |\n| \"probes fail to generalize\" | R1 | Empirical observation |\n| \"successful deployment\" | R1 | Outcome claim, not mechanism |\n\n### Overclaim Analysis\nNo significant overclaims detected. The paper:\n- Uses appropriate hedging (\"may be\")\n- Focuses on empirical performance, not mechanisms\n- Does not claim probes \"detect\" or \"identify\" internal states (which would be R3)\n\n### Replication Status: NA\n- Production paper, not standard academic replication context\n\n### Calibration Lesson\n**Production/applied papers** focused on probe performance tend to have appropriate claim levels because:\n1. Focus on external validity (does it work?)\n2. Less incentive for mechanistic narratives\n3. Engineering framing vs. science framing\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Overclaim Patterns by Paper Type\n\n| Paper Type | Typical Overclaim | Example |\n|------------|------------------|---------|\n| Circuit discovery | \"THE circuit\" + functional verbs | IOI |\n| Knowledge localization | \"stores,\" \"encodes\" | ROME |\n| Algorithm analysis | \"reverse-engineer,\" \"the algorithm\" | Grokking |\n| Method evaluation | Low overclaim (comparative) | SAE Eval |\n| Production/applied | Low overclaim (empirical focus) | Gemini Probes |\n\n## Key Linguistic Markers Summary\n\n### Rung 3 (Mechanistic) - Watch for:\n- \"encodes,\" \"represents,\" \"stores,\" \"contains\"\n- \"performs,\" \"computes,\" \"executes,\" \"implements\"\n- \"THE circuit/mechanism/algorithm\" (uniqueness)\n- \"uses X to do Y\" (mechanistic narrative)\n- \"is responsible for,\" \"controls,\" \"underlies\"\n\n### Rung 2 (Causal) - Appropriate for interventions:\n- \"causally affects,\" \"has causal effect\"\n- \"mediates,\" \"influences\"\n- \"is sufficient for,\" \"can produce\"\n- \"intervening on X changes Y\"\n\n### Rung 1 (Correlational) - Appropriate for probing/attribution:\n- \"correlates with,\" \"is associated with\"\n- \"predicts,\" \"is decodable from\"\n- \"activates on,\" \"fires when\"\n- \"information is present\"\n---\n\n## Inter-Annotator Calibration Notes\n\nFor the pilot study (single annotator), use these decision rules:\n\n1. **When in doubt about claim_rung:**\n   - Check for functional verbs (performs, computes) → R3\n   - Check for uniqueness language (the, only) → R3\n   - Check for storage/encoding language → R3\n\n2. **When in doubt about method_rung:**\n   - If no intervention on model → R1\n   - If intervention but not per-instance counterfactual → R2\n   - If establishes unique/necessary mechanism → R3\n\n3. **Edge cases:**\n   - Hedged R3 claims (\"may encode\") → still R3, note hedge in confidence\n   - Multi-method papers → use highest-rung method that directly supports claim\n   - Implicit claims from narrative → code but weight lower in confidence\n\n\n## Paper Context\nPaper ID: 2404.03592\nTitle: ReFT: Representation Finetuning for Language Models\nFull text:\n                  ReFT: Representation Finetuning\n                              for Language Models\n\n\n\n\n                          Zhengxuan Wu∗†  Aryaman Arora∗†  Zheng Wang†   Atticus Geiger‡\n                           Dan Jurafsky†   Christopher D.

We pursue\n                                    this hypothesis by developing a family of Representation Finetuning (ReFT)\n                             methods. ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and learn task-specific\n                                 interventions on hidden representations. We define a strong instance of the ReFT\n                                  family, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT), and we identify an ablation of[cs.CL]\n                                      this method that trades some performance for increased efficiency. Both are drop-in\n                              replacements for existing PEFTs and learn interventions that are 15×–65× more\n                                  parameter-efficient than LoRA. We showcase LoReFT on eight commonsense rea-\n                              soning tasks, four arithmetic reasoning tasks, instruction-tuning, and GLUE. In all\n                                 these evaluations, our ReFTs deliver the best balance of efficiency and performance,\n                            and almost always outperform state-of-the-art PEFTs. We release a generic ReFT\n                                  training library publicly at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft.\n\n\n                1  Introduction\n\n                       Pretrained language models (LMs) are frequently finetuned to adapt them to new domains or tasks\n                      [Dai and Le, 2015]. With finetuning, a single base model can be adapted to a variety of tasks given\n                     only small amounts of in-domain data. However, finetuning large LMs is expensive. Parameter-\n                            efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods propose to address the high costs of full finetuning by updating a\n                       small number of weights. This reduces memory usage and training time, and PEFTs achieve similararXiv:2404.03592v3               performance to full finetuning in many settings [Hu et al., 2023].\n\n              A hallmark of current state-of-the-art PEFTs is that they modify weights rather than representations.\n                    However, much prior interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich semantic\n                       information, suggesting that editing representations might be a more powerful alternative to weight\n                       updates. In this paper, we pursue this hypothesis by developing and motivating Representation\n                    Finetuning (ReFT). Instead of adapting model weights, ReFT methods train interventions that\n                     manipulate a small fraction of model representations in order to steer model behaviors to solve\n                    downstream tasks at inference time. ReFT methods are drop-in replacements for weight-based PEFTs.\n                      This approach is inspired by recent work in LM interpretability that intervenes on representations to\n                          find faithful causal mechanisms [Geiger et al., 2023b] and to steer model behaviours at inference time\n                       [Turner et al., 2023, Li et al., 2024], and it can be seen as a generalisation of the representation-editing\n                   work of Wu et al. [2024a], Turner et al. [2023], and Zou et al. [2023] (see appendix B for details).\n\n                           *Equal contribution.\n\n\n\n                            Preprint.

Despite training far fewer\nparameters than existing PEFTs, LoReFT achieves competitive or even state-of-the-art performance\non all tasks.  Its value is most apparent for the largest models in our evaluations. Note: FT is\nfull-parameter finetuning, which is not a PEFT or ReFT method. Additional results are in section 4.\n\n\nWe focus on a strong and highly efficient instance of the ReFT family that we call Low-rank\nLinear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT). LoReFT is a parametrisation of ReFT that intervenes on hidden\nrepresentations in the linear subspace spanned by a low-rank projection matrix, building directly\non the distributed alignment search (DAS) method of Geiger et al. [2023b] and Wu et al. [2023].\nWe also identify an ablation of this method (DiReFT) that trades some performance for increased\nefficiency. We evaluate our ReFTs on LLaMA-family models and small-scale LMs against existing\nPEFTs on standard benchmarks from four domains: commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning,\ninstruction-following, and natural language understanding. Compared to LoRA, we find that LoReFT\nuses 15×–65× times fewer parameters while achieving state-of-the-art performance on commonsense\nreasoning, instruction-following, and natural language understanding against the strongest PEFTs.\nThese findings indicate that ReFT methods are worthy of further exploration, as they may emerge as\nmore efficient and effective alternatives to weight-based PEFTs.\n\n2  Related work\n\nParameter-efficient finetuning methods (PEFTs). PEFTs train a fraction of the model’s parameters\nto adapt it to downstream tasks. We classify PEFTs into three categories:\n\n  1. Adapter-based methods train additional modules (e.g. fully-connected layers) on top of the\n     frozen pretrained model. Series adapters insert components between LM attention or MLP\n     layers [Houlsby et al., 2019, Pfeiffer et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2022, He et al., 2022b, Fu et al.,\n     2021], while parallel adapters add modules alongside existing components [He et al., 2022a].\n     Since adapters add new components that cannot be easily folded into existing model weights,\n     they impose an additional burden at inference time.1\n  2. LoRA [Hu et al., 2022] and DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c] use low-rank matrices to approximate\n     additive weight updates during training, and require no additional overhead during inference\n     since the weight updates can be merged into the model. These are the strongest PEFTs currently.2\n  3. Prompt-based methods add randomly-initialised soft tokens to the input (usually as a prefix)\n    and train their embeddings while keeping the LM weights frozen [Li and Liang, 2021]. These\n\n   1Several very recent papers introduce new adapter architectures but do not benchmark them on the tasks\nwe consider, or they perform hyperparameter-tuning in a different setup than done in this work. These include:\nLLaMA-Adapter [Zhang et al., 2024b], LLaMA-Adapter v2 [Gao et al., 2023], Aligner [Ziheng et al., 2023].\n    2Additional methods not studied in this work: AutoLoRA [Zhang et al., 2024c], ResLoRA [Shi et al., 2024],\nSiRA [Zhu et al., 2023].\n\n\n                                       2\n\n    methods are often far from optimal compared to other PEFTs, and come at the cost of significant\n     inference overhead. A variant of this method where hidden-layer activations are also tuned was\n     introduced as a baseline in Hu et al. [2022], with better performance.\n\nRepresentation editing. Recent work on activation steering and representation engineering shows\nthat adding fixed or task-specific steering vectors [Subramani et al., 2022, Turner et al., 2023, Zou\net al., 2023, Liu et al., 2024b, Vogel, 2024, Li et al., 2024] or applying concept erasure [Ravfogel\net al., 2022, Belrose et al., 2023, Avitan et al., 2024, Singh et al., 2024] to the residual stream can\nenable a degree of control over pretrained LM generations without the need for resource-intensive\nfinetuning [Wu et al., 2024a]. The success of these methods affirms that representations induced by\npretrained LMs carry rich semantic structure.\n\nInterventional interpretability. Much recent work has used interventions on model-internal states\nto test hypotheses about how LMs implement various behaviours. In particular, interventions on linear\nsubspaces of representations have provided increasing evidence that human-interpretable concepts are\nencoded linearly [Smolensky, 1986, Rumelhart et al., 1986, McClelland et al., 1986]. This includes\nlinguistic features such as gender and number [Lasri et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023, Hanna et al.,\n2023, Chintam et al., 2023, Yamakoshi et al., 2023, Hao and Linzen, 2023, Chen et al., 2023, Amini\net al., 2023, Guerner et al., 2023, Arora et al., 2024], logical and mathematical reasoning [Wu et al.,\n2023], entity attributes [Huang et al., 2024], and a number of other domains [Mikolov et al., 2013,\nElhage et al., 2022, Park et al., 2023, Nanda et al., 2023, Guerner et al., 2023].\n\n3  ReFT\n\nWe now define the ReFT family of methods. To do this, we first summarize the core motivation,\nwhich emerges from work on intervention-based model interpretability. We then show how this leads\ndirectly to Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT). Finally, we generalize this to a family of\nReFT methods. Appendix A provides a brief overview of our generic ReFT training library.\n\nTo keep the presentation simple, we assume throughout that our target model is a Transformer-\nbased [Vaswani et al., 2017] LM that produces contextualised representations of sequences of tokens.\nGiven a sequence of n input tokens x = (x1,...,xn), the model first embeds these into a list of\nrepresentations h(0) = (h(0)1  ,...,h(0)n  ). Then, m layers successively compute the j-th list of hidden\nrepresentations h(j) as a function of the previous list of hidden representations h(j−1). Each hidden\nrepresentation is a vector h ∈Rd. The LM uses the final hidden representations h(m) to produce its\npredictions. In our experiments, we consider both autoregressive LMs and masked LMs [Devlin et al.,\n2019]. An autoregressive LM predicts p(xn+1 ∣x1,...,xn) = softmax(Wh(m)n   ), while a masked\nLM predicts p(xi ∣x1,...,xi−1,xi+1,...,xn) = softmax(Wh(m)i   ), where W is a learned matrix\nmapping from representations to logits over the vocabulary space.\n\n3.1  Motivation\n\nIn interpretability research, the framework of causal abstraction [Geiger et al., 2021] uses interchange\ninterventions to establish the causal role of representations in deep learning models. An interchange\nintervention fixes a representation to the value it would take if a counterfactual input were processed\nby the model. Experiments investigating how such interventions affect model behavior form the\nevidence for claims about the causal role of a representation and the concept it encodes.\n\nTo test whether a concept is encoded in a linear subspace of a representation, one may use a dis-\ntributed interchange intervention (DII) [Geiger et al., 2023b].3 Let b be the hidden representation\ncreated at row i and column k when our model processes input b, and let s be the corresponding\nrepresentation when that same model processes input s. A distributed interchange intervention on b\ngiven a counterfactual source representation s is then defined as\n\n                          DII(b,s,R) = b + R⊺(Rs −Rb)                               (1)\n\nwhere R ∈Rr×d is a low-rank projection matrix with orthonormal rows, d is the representation\ndimensionality, and r is the dimensionality of the subspace we are intervening on. We learn the\nsubspace R using distributed alignment search (DAS), which finds the subspace that maximises the\n\n   3This notion of subspace intervention was also independently discovered by Guerner et al. [2023].\n\n\n                                       3\n\n  ReFTReFT InterventionIntervention                   LoReFTLoReFT\n\n                                                                                                                   Φ(h)  edit restricted\n                                                                                                                                     to subspace\n\n                                                                                          +\n                                                                                                                       RT  edit                                                                               subspaceofR)                                                                                     edit                                                                               (rows                                    vector\n\n                                                                                           +      -\n                                                          W    b    R\n\n                                 this      is   some   text\n                                                                                         h      h          h\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of ReFT. (1) The left panel depicts an intervention I: the intervention function\nΦ is applied to hidden representations at positions P in layer l. (2) The right panel depicts the\nintervention function used in LoReFT, which finds an edit vector that only modifies the representation\nin the linear subspace spanned by the rows of R. Specifically, we show how a rank-2 LoReFT\noperates on 3-dimensional hidden representations.\n\n\nprobability of the expected counterfactual output after intervention [Geiger et al., 2023b]. DAS is\nhighly expressive, and can effectively localize concepts within model representations [Wu et al., 2023,\nArora et al., 2024, Wu et al., 2024c, Huang et al., 2024]. This suggests that subspace representation\ninterventions could also be a powerful tool for model control.\n\n3.2  Two low-rank ReFT instantiations\n\nLoReFT. The formulation of DII in eq. (1) immediately suggests a way to control model generations\nvia interventions. The guiding intuition is that we can learn how to perform interventions that steer\nthe model towards predicting our task labels. The resulting method, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT\n(LoReFT), is defined by the following variant of eq. (1):\n                         ΦLoReFT(h) = h + R⊺(Wh + b −Rh)                            (2)\n\nThis is identical to eq. (1), except we use a learned projected source Rs = Wh + b. LoReFT thus\nedits the representation in the r-dimensional subspace spanned by the rows of R to take on the\nvalues obtained from our linear projection Wh + b. We depict this operation in fig. 2. The learned\nparameters are ϕ = {R,W,b}; the parameters of the LM are frozen. As with DII, R ∈Rr×d is a\nlow-rank matrix with orthonormal rows where d is the hidden-state dimensionality and r ≤d is the\nrank of the subspace. We further define a linear projection W ∈Rr×d and bias vector b ∈Rr.\n\nDiReFT. In addition, we define an ablation of LoReFT which removes the orthogonality constraint\nand the difference operation, reducing training time:\n                           ΦDiReFT(h) = h + W⊺2 (W1h + b)                              (3)\nBoth W1,W2 ∈Rr×d are low-rank projection matrices. Note that eq. (3) resembles LoRA, and thus\nDiReFT can be thought of as LoRA applied directly to hidden representations at certain positions.4\nEmpirical evidence from previous work suggests that adding orthogonal constraints to LoRA weights\nincreases performance [Liu et al., 2024d]. (Appendix E reports results for additional ablations of\nLoReFT.)\n\nTraining objective. We consider both generation tasks using decoder-only or encoder–decoder\nLMs and classification tasks using encoder-only models. The pretrained language model induces a\ndistribution over token sequences p(⋅). We denote the model that results from the ReFT intervention\nΦ on p(⋅) as pΦ(⋅) with trainable parameters ϕ. To simplify notation, we refer to the hidden\nrepresentations produced by the LM on input x as h(x), and those by the intervened LM as hΦ(x).\n\nFor generation tasks, our training objective is language modelling. Given an input sequence x =\n(x1,...,xn) with n tokens as the prompt, the goal is to predict the output sequence y = (y1,...,ym)\n\n   4LoRA is not applicable to the residual stream, which is weightless. LoRA can be configured to apply only\nto the attention layer output projection matrix, which is similar to our residual stream intervention. However,\nprevious works found that applying LoRA only to attention layers is sub-optimal [Hu et al., 2023].\n\n\n                                       4\n\nwith m tokens. We minimise the cross-entropy loss with teacher-forcing over all output positions.\n\n                        m\n                         min {− ∑ log pΦ (yi ∣xy<i)}                                 (4)\n                              ϕ                                              i=1\n\nFor single-label classification tasks, we add a classification head Hθ(⋅) with parameters θ that takes\nthe final-layer representation at the first token (CLS) as input and outputs a distribution over classes.\nH has the learned parameters θ = {Wo,bo,Wd,bd}.\n                Hθ(⋅∣h) = softmax(Wo(tanh(Wdh(m)1  + bd)) + bo)                   (5)\n\nWe learn the parameters of the head and those of the intervention function Φ. We minimise the\ncross-entropy loss of the target class y given input x:\n\n                          min {−log Hθ(y ∣hΦ(x))}                                  (6)\n                                        ϕ,θ\n\n3.3  The ReFT family of methods\n\nIt is straightforward to generalise the above intervention functions to define a family of intervention-\nbased representation finetuning methods. We first define a general notion of intervention, i.e. the\nmodification of hidden representations during the model forward pass:\nDefinition 3.1. An intervention I is a tuple ⟨Φ,P,l⟩that encapsulates a single inference-time\nmodification of the representations computed by a Transformer-based LM. The three components of\nan intervention are (1) the intervention function Φ ∶Rd →Rd with learned parameters ϕ, (2) a set\nof input positions P ⊆{1,...,n} that the intervention is applied to, and (3) the layer l ∈{1,...,m}\nat which the intervention is applied.\n\nWe implement the intervention I as the following operation that overwrites some representations h:\n                            h(l) ←(Φ(h(l)p ) if p ∈P else h(l)p  )p∈1,...,n                          (7)\n\nThe intervention is applied immediately after the computation of h(l) and thus affects the representa-\ntions computed in later layers h(l+1),...,h(m).\n\nFigure 2 provides a schematic overview of an intervention. A ReFT is then defined as a constrained\nset of non-overlapping interventions:\nDefinition 3.2. A ReFT method is a set of f interventions I = {I1,...,If}. We enforce that for\nany two interventions Ij,Ik ∈I such that they operate on the same layer lj = lk, their intervention\npositions must be disjoint, i.e. Pj ∩Pk = ∅. The parameters (ϕ1,...,ϕf) of all of the intervention\nfunctions are independent.\n\nReFT is thus a generic framework encompassing interventions on hidden representations during the\nmodel forward pass. In appendix B, we show how a variety of existing inference-time intervention\nmethods can be described within this framework.\n\n4  Experiments\n\nTo evaluate our ReFTs against existing PEFTs, we conduct experiments across four diverse NLP\nbenchmarks covering more than 20 datasets (extensive details on our datasets are in appendix C).\nOur goal is to provide a rich picture of how LoReFT and DiReFT perform in different scenarios. We\nexperiment with both masked and autoregressive LMs at different scales, ranging from RoBERTa-\nbase [Liu et al., 2019] with 125M to LLaMA models [Touvron et al., 2023a,b] with 13B parameters.\nWe benchmark against existing PEFTs such as prefix-tuning [Li and Liang, 2021], adapter-tuning\nwith both Series Adapters and Parallel Adapters, BitFit [Ben Zaken et al., 2022], RED [Wu et al.,\n2024a], LoRA [Hu et al., 2022], and DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c]. Our comparisons focus on both\nperformance and parameter efficiency. In our comparisons, we use hyperparameter-tuned scores from\nprevious works when possible. We load our base LMs in torch.bfloat16 to save memory. All of\nour experiments are run with a single GPU: NVIDIA A100 40G/80G or RTX 6000. Examples of\nraw model generations are in appendix I.\n\n\n                                       5\n\n4.1  Hyperparameter configuration\n\nFor our experiments, we must decide how many interventions to learn and which layers and input\npositions to apply each one on. We propose learning interventions on a fixed number of p prefix and\ns suffix positions in the prompt. Specifically, we tune four hyperparameters:\n\n  1. The number of prefix positions p to intervene on, i.e. positions {1,...,p}.\n  2. The number of suffix positions s to intervene on, i.e. positions {n −s + 1,...,n}.\n  3. Which set of layers L to intervene on.\n  4. Whether or not to tie intervention parameters ϕ across different positions in the same layer.\n\nThis simplifies the hyperparameter search space; compared to LoRA, the only additional consideration\nis which positions to intervene on. Since the number of positions edited is constant, LoReFT and\nDiReFT contribute a fixed additional inference cost that does not scale with prompt length.\n\nGiven the positions P = {1,...,p} ∪{n −s + 1,...,n}, we define the untied and tied variants:\n\n                   Iuntied = {⟨Φ,{p},l⟩∣p ∈P,l ∈L}                 Itied = {⟨Φ,P,l⟩∣l ∈L}\n\nAdditionally, when applying LoReFT and DiReFT to a prompt with length n where n < p + s, we\nset p ←min(p,⌊n/2⌋) and s ←min(s,⌈n/2⌉) and do not apply the truncated interventions in Iuntied.\nWe also tune neural-network training hyperparameters.\n\nUnlike previous work [Hu et al., 2022, 2023, Liu et al., 2024c] where hyperparameter tuning\nmay involve optimising performance directly on test sets, we only tune our hyperparameters on\ndevelopment sets which do not contain any overlapping examples with the test sets of our tasks. We\nfurther describe hyperparameter tuning for each benchmark in appendix D.1.\n\n4.2  Commonsense reasoning\n\nWe replicate the experimental setup in Hu  et  al. [2023] and finetune LLaMA-1 7B/13B,\nLlama-2 7B, and Llama-3 8B5 on a combined dataset of eight commonsense reasoning tasks\n(COMMONSENSE170K). We report scores on each task’s test set individually. We compare with\nPEFTs benchmarked in Hu et al. [2023] as well as the identical experiment reported in Liu et al.\n[2024c] for DoRA.\n\nDatasets. Our benchmark contains eight commonsense reasoning datasets, including BoolQ [Clark\net al., 2019], PIQA [Bisk et al., 2020], SIQA [Sap et al., 2019], HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019],\nWinoGrande [Sakaguchi et al., 2021], ARC-e, ARC-c [Clark et al., 2018], and OBQA [Mihaylov\net al., 2018]. Examples are formulated as multiple-choice problems where the model needs to directly\ngenerate the correct choice without rationales. We use the same prompt template as in Hu et al.\n[2023] with additional string normalisation (removing leading and trailing whitespace).\n\nHyperparameter tuning. We do not do hyperparameter selection based on test set results. Rather,\nwe use the hyperparameter settings of the model that performs best on a development set created\nfrom the GSM8K training set, except we use a lower number of epochs (6 instead of 12) because\nthe COMMONSENSE170K training set is more than 20 times larger than GSM8K. This allows us to\ntune relevant hyperparamters, and also serves to test the robustness of these settings across different\ndomains. We additionally report scores on 3 epochs in appendix D.3.\n\nResults. We report results in table 1. LoReFT sets state-of-the-art performance on the commonsense\nreasoning tasks, outperforming all other methods by a considerable margin. While being more\ncompute-efficient, DiReFT achieves only slightly worse performance consistently.\n\n4.3  Arithmetic reasoning\n\nSimilar to the previous experiment, we follow the experimental setup in Hu et al. [2023] and finetune\nLLaMA-1 7B and 13B on a combined dataset of seven arithmetic reasoning tasks with LM-generated\nchain-of-thought steps (MATH10K) and report scores on four of the tasks’ test sets. We only evaluate\ncorrectness on the final numeric or multiple-choice answer.\n\n   5Llama-3 8B appeared on April 18, 2024, and thus we had time to complete only commonsense reasoning\nexperiments with this model. Liu et al. [2024c] report corresponding results for LoRA and DoRA.\n\n\n                                       6\n\nTable 1: Accuracy comparison of LLaMA-1 7B/13B, Llama-2 7B and Llama-3 8B against existing\nPEFT methods on eight commonsense reasoning datasets. ∗Performance results of all baseline\nmethods are taken from Liu et al. [2024c]. We report averaged performance of three runs with distinct\nrandom seeds for our method. For our methods, Param.

We use the same hyperparameter settings as for the Commonsense Rea-\nsoning benchmark, but with 12 epochs for training. We also report scores on 3 epochs.\n\nDatasets. Our benchmark contains four datasets for math world problems, including AQuA [Ling\net al., 2017], GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], MAWPS [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016], and SVAMP [Pa-\ntel et al., 2021]. Models need to generate chain-of-thought [Wei et al., 2022] before the final answer.\nWe use the same prompt template and hyperparameter settings as in the previous experiment.\n\nResults. We report results in table 2. We find that both LoReFT and DiReFT do not perform as\nwell at arithmetic reasoning tasks compared to LoRA and adapters, but do outperform prefix-tuning.\nOur results suggest that our ReFTs may have more trouble on chain-of-thought reasoning than the\nsingle-step commonsense reasoning tasks due to the length of generations (greater length necessarily\nreduces the effect of the intervention) and overall greater difficulty of the task. Our results show that\nour ReFTs perform better with the 13B model than the 7B model, which suggests that our methods\nscale with model size. Overall, we note that the arithmetic reasoning results show a lot of variation,\nwith no single method emerging as a clear winner across all of them.\n\n4.4  Instruction-following\n\nBase LMs require instruction finetuning to follow human prompts [Ouyang et al., 2022]. We follow\nthe experimental setup in Wu et al. [2024a] and finetune Llama-2 7B with Ultrafeedback [Cui et al.,\n2023]. We compare against full parameter finetuning, LoRA, and RED. For evaluation, we use\nAlpaca-Eval v1.0 [Li et al., 2023], which computes the win-rate against text-davinci-003 using\nGPT-4 as the annotator. We use the same prompt template as in Taori et al. [2023].\n\nDatasets. Ultrafeedback is high-quality instruction dataset where responses are generated via scoring\na diverse set of model responses from a list of candidates (e.g. ChatGPT and Bard). The score\nis calculated as a weighted score of instruction-following, truthfulness, honesty, and helpfulness.\n\n\n                                       7\n\nTable 2: Accuracy comparison of LLaMA-1 7B/13B against existing PEFT methods on four arithmetic\nreasoning datasets. ∗Performance results of all baseline methods are taken from Hu et al.

We do hyperparameter-tuning on the unseen instruction-following dataset\nAlpaca-52K [Taori et al., 2023] with only LLaMA-7B to prevent test-set hill-climbing. We then\nuse the hyperparameter settings of our best performing model to finetune on Ultrafeedback. For\nhyperparameter tuning, we use Alpaca-Eval v1.0 with GPT-4 turbo as the annotator for fast turnaround,\nwhich also prevents overfitting with GPT-4 as a judge.\n\nResults. We report results in table 3. When matched in parameter count to the previous most\nparameter-efficient PEFT (RED) and trained on Llama-2 7B, LoReFT outperforms all reported\nfinetuning methods (including full finetuning) and achieves a win-rate within 1% of GPT-3.5 Turbo\n1106. Furthermore, after halving the parameter count or using only 1/64-th of the data, LoReFT still\noutperforms other finetuning methods.

We use\nthis set of experiments to show LoReFT works well even with small-scale LMs, and can improve\nrepresentations for classification tasks and not just text generation. We finetune RoBERTa-base\n(125M) as well as RoBERTa-large (350M) on GLUE, a sequence classification benchmark for natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU) which covers domains such as sentiment classification and natural\nlanguage inference. Details about the GLUE benchmark can be found in its original paper. We\nfollow Wu et al. [2024a] for proper evaluation on GLUE validation set: we split the validation set into\ntwo sets guarded by a random seed, and we pick the best model with highest in-training validation\naccuracy to evaluate on the other held-out half for testing accuracy.\n\nHyperparameter tuning. We tune our hyperparameters for each task separately. which is standard\nfor PEFTs. To avoid overfitting to random seeds, we hyperparameter-tune our models with a\nconstant seed, and report averaged results over that and four additional unseen seeds. We describe\nhyperparameter tuning experiments in Appendix D.1.\n\nResults. We report results in table 4. LoReFT obtains comparable performance with PEFT methods\non both model sizes when parameter matched with RED, the previous most parameter-efficient PEFT\nfor this task. Furthermore, DiReFT achieves worse performance than most of the PEFTs suggesting\nLoReFT is a better choice when LM is small. Full results with standard deviation is in table 13. We\nadditionally compare against VeRA [Kopiczko et al., 2024] in appendix D.3.\n\n5  Limitations\n\nDue to limited resources, we mainly explored the LLaMA-family of models. In future work, we hope\nto explore the effectiveness of ReFT on other model families as well as vision–language models such\nas LLaVA [Liu et al., 2024a]. The capabilities of ReFT have not yet been fully explored due to the\nlarge hyperparameter search space; we are interested in automating this search. We provide some\ninitial explorations of LM personalisation with ReFT in a few-shot setting in appendix G.2. We hope\nto explore why ReFT works, and we provide some of our early explorations focused on memorisation\n(appendix F.1, appendix F.2). We are also investigating whether learned orthogonal subspaces can be\ncomposed together without adaptation. Some encouraging initial findings are in appendix G.1.\n\nReFT, abstraction, and generation. Neural network interpretability research often struggles to\ncontribute directly to improving models. With ReFT, we have shown one way to overcome this\nchallenge. The ReFT framework is rooted in work on causal abstraction [Geiger et al., 2023a] for\nmodel interpretability, and LoReFT builds directly on the distributed interchange intervention method\n\n\n                                       9\n\nof Geiger et al. [2023b] and Wu et al. [2023]. See also the interchange intervention training (IIT)\nmethod of Geiger et al. [2022], Wu et al. [2022], Huang et al. [2023c]. In a similar vein, recent work\nalso uses representation-based editing of the Transformer stream to steer model behavior [Li et al.,\n2024, Zou et al., 2023]. ReFT advances this line of work by showing one way that such steering can\nbe learned, rather than being merely a post hoc analysis step.\n\nThe precise ways in which ReFT works deserve deeper exploration. Although these methods intervene\non representations, the causal effect of such interventions may only emerge in the model’s upstream\ncomputations. In other words, the power of ReFT may come from the fact that it creates new causal\npathways or modifies the strength of some existing ones. We leave it to future research to track these\neffects, and perhaps to explore more structured ReFTs to modify complex causal pathways in LMs.\n\nReFT and model interpretability. ReFT relies on insights from work on interpretability, and it may\nalso be able to contribute insights back to that field. In particular, LoReFT shows that training a set\nof low-rank interventions on selected residual streams can induce a base LM to follow instructions\n(section 4.4). In other words, a linear subspace distributed across a set of neurons can achieve\ngeneralised control over a vast number of tasks. This is a serious challenge to work seeing to interpret\nindividual neurons in isolation (for related criticisms, see Huang et al. 2023b). The success of ReFT\nsuggests to us a quite different approach to interperetability, one that starts from the assumption that\nneurons will play different roles in different contexts.\n\nEvaluation practices in PEFT research. In this work, we hyperparameter-tune ReFT on develop-\nment sets that do not overlap with the test set. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of the literature\non PEFTs directly hill-climbs performance on test sets. This results in overfitting to specific tasks,\nwhich gives practitioners less certainty about the real-world performance of different methods and\nimpedes fair comparison. We hope that future work can introduce benchmarks for evaluating PEFTs\nand ReFTs. These should allow for compute- or time-matched hyperparameter-tuning comparisons,\nand they should disallow any kind of tuning or model selection based on the test set.\n\n6  Conclusion\n\nWe propose a strong alternative to PEFTs, LoReFT, and we identify an ablation of this method,\nDiReFT, that trades some performance for increased efficiency. Overall, LoReFT achieves strong per-\nformance across benchmarks from four domains while being 15×–65× more efficient than LoRA. No-\ntably, LoReFT establishes new state-of-the-art performance on commonsense reasoning, instruction-\nfollowing, and natural language understanding against the strongest PEFTs. We also show how our\nmethod can be described under a generic framework – ReFT. ReFT is a new approach to finetuning\nthat is more powerful, more parameter-efficient, and more interpretable than any existing PEFTs.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Jing Huang for helpful discussion in designing our memorisation tests as well as writing.\nWe thank Chenglei Si, Harshit Joshi, Jordan Juravsky, Julie Kallini, Ken Liu, Rohan Pandey, Jiuding\nSun, Leonard Tang, Tristan Thrush, Shengguang Wu, Qinan Yu, Yanzhe Zhang, Amir Zur, and Shiqi\nChen for helpful discussion about the project and comments on the manuscript.\n\nReferences\n\nAfra Amini, Tiago Pimentel, Clara Meister, and Ryan Cotterell.

Our library is built on top of pyvene [Wu et al., 2024b], a library for performing\nand training activation interventions on arbitrary PyTorch models. Any pretrained LM available\non HuggingFace is supported through our library for finetuning with ReFT methods, and finetuned\nmodels can be easily uploaded to HuggingFace. The following example shows steps to wrap a\nLlama-2 7B model with a single intervention on the residual stream output of the 19-th layer:\n\n  import torch\n  import transformers\n  from pyreft import get_reft_model , ReftConfig , LoreftIntervention , ReftTrainerForCausalLM\n\n  # loading huggingface model\n  model_name_or_path = \"yahma/llama -7b-hf\"\n  model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n      model_name_or_path , torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16 , device_map=\"cuda\")\n  # wrap the model with rank -1 loreft\n  reft_config = ReftConfig(representations ={\n      \"layer\": 19, \"component\": \"block_output\",\n      \"intervention\": LoreftIntervention(\n      embed_dim=model.config.hidden_size , low_rank_dimension =1)})\n  reft_model = get_reft_model(model , reft_config)\n  reft_model.print_trainable_parameters ()\n\n\n\nThe wrapped model can be trained for downstream tasks. We also provide data loading helpers to\nconstruct training data that is compatible with HuggingFace trainers:\n\n  tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)\n\n  # get training data with customised dataloaders\n  data_module = make_supervised_data_module(\n      tokenizer=tokenizer , model=model , layers =[19] ,\n      training_args=training_args , data_args=data_args)\n  # train\n  trainer = reft.ReftTrainerForCausalLM(\n      model=reft_model , tokenizer=tokenizer , args=training_args , ** data_module)\n  trainer.train()\n  trainer.save_model(output_dir=training_args.output_dir)\n\n\nB  Describing existing methods under the ReFT framework\n\nTo show the expressivity of the ReFT framework, we cast existing representing-editing methods in\nthe literature into ReFTs.\n\nGeneral comments about expressivity of ReFT. Given that previous works have unified PEFTs\nunder a single framework [He et al., 2022a], one may ask why not express ReFT as a PEFT\nmethod? The main reason is that PEFT frameworks lack the notion of time or sequence (see the\nunified PEFT view provided in Table 1 on pg. 5 of He et al., 2022a). In PEFTs, representation\nmodifications are necessarily applied to every token in the sequence, even in recent variants such as\nAdaLoRA [Zhang et al., 2023]. A key aspect of ReFT is that it leverages representations over time\nand intervenes only on a small number of them while being effective. More importantly, the notation\nof time is important for future versions of ReFT that intervene on representations schematically\n(e.g. intervene on the first token at some early layers and then intervene on the last token at some later\nlayers). The ability to intervene at different layer and position combinations schematically is also\nsupported in our code. Existing PEFT libraries 7 enforce weight-based updates without supporting\nflexible representation-based interventions.\n\nB.1 RED\n\nRED [Wu et al., 2024a] is a simple representation-editing method that applies an element-wise scaling\ntransform s ∈Rn and adds a bias b ∈Rn to the hidden representation in every layer. The same\nintervention is applied to every position (including at generated tokens, increasing inference burden)\n\n   7See https://github.com/huggingface/peft.\n\n\n                                       20\n\nbut separate interventions are learned at each layer. In the ReFT framework, RED is defined as\n\n                  ΦRED(h) = s × h + b                                                     (8)\n                        IRED = {⟨ΦRED,{1,...,n},l⟩∣l ∈{1,...,m}}                      (9)\n\nThe parameters ϕRED = {s,b} are learned with gradient descent to minimise a loss function such as\nlanguage-modelling loss or a classification loss, as in our experiments with LoReFT. We believe that\nRED is better classified as a kind of adapter due to its application at all positions.\n\nB.2  Activation addition\n\nActivation addition [Turner et al., 2023] takes the difference in activations at at some positions p and\nq and layer l given two contrastive prompts x+ and x−as input. It then adds this difference vector,\nscaled by a tuned constant c, to representations at all positions in layer l for some new prompt.\n                             a = h(x+)(l)p  −h(x−)(l)q                               (10)\n                          ΦActAdd(h) = h + c ⋅a                                         (11)\n                                   IActAdd = {⟨ϕActAdd,{1,...,n},l⟩}                         (12)\n\nB.3  RepE\n\nZou et al. [2023] introduce several intervention methods for controlling model behaviour, which they\nterm representation engineering.\n\nFirst, given a set of prompts {x1,...,xn} designed to elicit the presence of a concept, we randomly\npair them, take the difference in activations for each pair, and find the first principle component of the\ndifference vectors at the last token position in some layer of interest l to obtain a reading vector:\n                        areading = PCA({h(xi)(l)−1 −h(xi+1)(l)−1 ∣i ≡0 mod 2})                  (13)                                                                             1\nOne can also used a more structured pairing of constrastive prompts to obtain a contrast vector,\nsimilar to the difference vector computed in activation addition:\n                           acontrast = PCA({h(x+i )(l)−1 −h(x−i )(l)−1 ∣1 ≤i ≤n})                   (14)                                                                           1\nThen, using either areading or acontrast, RepE introduces three operators (i.e. parametrisations of Φ)\nfor intervening on activations:\n\n                                 ΦRepE,linear(h) = h ± c ⋅a                                    (15)\n                              ΦRepE,piecewise(h) = h + c ⋅sign(a ⋅h) ⋅a                        (16)\n                                            ⋅h                               ΦRepE,projection(h) = h −c ⋅a   ⋅a                              (17)\n                                                 ∥a∥2\n\nThe first two of these are similar to activation addition, while the latter is a scaled one-dimensional\ndistributed interchange intervention that is a special case of LoReFT. These operations are then used\nto intervene on some set of positions P ⊆{1,...,n} in the layer of interest:\n\n                                     IRepE = {⟨ΦRepE,P,l⟩}                                 (18)\n\nRepE introduces another model control method called Low-Rank Representation Adaptation\n(LoRRA), which is a kind of PEFT rather than a ReFT since it tunes model weights using a variant of\nLoRA.\n\nC  Datasets\n\nC.1  Commonsense reasoning\n\nWe train and evaluate our models on eight datasets covering different domains of open-ended QA\ntasks:\n\n      1. The BoolQ [Clark et al., 2019] dataset, which is a question-answering dataset for yes or\n       no naturally occurring questions. We remove the provided passage in the dataset following\n         previous works to ensure a fair comparison.\n\n\n                                       21\n\n      2. The PIQA [Bisk et al., 2020] dataset, which tests physical commonsense reasoning and\n         requires the model to choose one of the provided actions to take based on a hypothesised\n         scenario.\n      3. The SIQA [Sap et al., 2019] dataset, which focus on reasoning about people’s actions and\n          their corresponding social consequences.\n      4. The HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019] dataset, which asks the model to choose an appropriate\n        ending (or sentence completion) given a context.\n      5. The WinoGrande [Sakaguchi et al., 2021] dataset, inspired by Winograd Schema Chal-\n        lenge [Levesque et al., 2012], asks the model to fill-in-a-blank with binary options given a\n        sentence which requires commonsense reasoning.\n      6. The ARC Easy set (ARC-e [Clark et al., 2018]), which includes genuine grade-school level\n         multiple-choice science questions\n      7. The ARC Challenge set (ARC-c) [Clark et al., 2018]), which is like ARC-e but designed in\n        a way that co-occurrence methods are expected to fail to answer correctly.\n      8. The OBQA [Mihaylov et al., 2018] dataset, which is a knowledge-intensive and open-book\n     QA dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning. Dataset statistics and simplified training\n        examples from each dataset are provided in Hu et al. [2023].\n\nDataset statistics and simplified training examples from each dataset are provided in Hu et al. [2023].\nWe replicate the experimental setup in Hu et al. [2023] and finetune our models on a combined training\ndataset (COMMONSENSE170K) of the tasks mentioned above, and evaluate on their individual test\nset.\n\nC.2  Arithmetic reasoning\n\nWe train and evaluate with seven datasets covering different domains of math world problems:\n\n      1. The AddSub [Hosseini et al., 2014] dataset, which involves solving arithmetic word prob-\n        lems that include addition and subtraction.\n      2. The AQuA [Ling et al., 2017] dataset, which formulates algebraic word problems as\n         multiple-choice problems.\n      3. The GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021] dataset, which consists of grade-school math word\n        problems that require multi-step reasoning.\n      4. The MAWPS [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016] dataset, which contains math word problem\n        with varying complexity.\n      5. The MultiArith [Roy and Roth, 2015] dataset, which contains multi-step arithmetic prob-\n         lems.\n      6. The SingleEq [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2015] dataset, which has grade-school math word\n        problems that map to single equations with different length.\n      7. The SVAMP [Patel et al., 2021] dataset, which enhances the original Math World Prob-\n       lem (MWP) challenge by requiring robust reasoning ability that is invariant to structural\n         alternations of the posing problem.\n\nDataset statistics and simplified training examples from each dataset are provided in Hu et al. [2023].\nWe replicate the experimental setup in Hu et al. [2023] and finetune our models on a combined\ntraining dataset (MATH10K) of four tasks mentioned above: GSM8K, MAWPS, MAWPS-single\nand AQuA. Different from Hu et al. [2023], selected tasks are excluded for testing since the original\npaper accidentally leaks testing examples from these tasks into the training set, affecting AddSub,\nMultiArith and SingleEq. They are included in the MAWPS training dataset, and thus leaked into the\ntraining dataset.\n\nC.3  Natural language understanding\n\nWe follow Wu et al. [2024a] for proper evaluation on the GLUE validation set. We split the validation\nset into two subsets, using one subset guarded by a random seed for in-training evaluation and the\nother for testing. Specifically, after each training epoch, we evaluate the model on our in-training\n\n\n                                       22\n\nevaluation set and select the best model across all epochs for testing. For datasets with a large\nvalidation set (i.e., QQP, MNLI, and QNLI), we select 1,000 samples for in-training evaluation. For\nthe remaining smaller datasets, we select half of the samples for this purpose. For the evaluation\nmetric, we use the Matthews correlation coefficient for CoLA, the Pearson correlation coefficient for\nSTS-B, and accuracy for the other datasets. For MNLI, we report results only on the matched version.\n\nD  Hyperparameters\n\nD.1  Hyperparameter tuning and decoding strategy\n\nCommonsense reasoning and arithmeric reasoning. We create a standalone development set by\ntaking the last 300 examples from the GSM8K training set. We train our models with the remaining\ntraining set of GSM8K and select the hyperparameter settings based on model performance on the\ndevelopment set. We select the hyperparameters using LLaMA-7B, and apply the same settings to\nLLaMA-13B without additional tuning. We use a maximum sequence length of 512 for training and\nhyperparameter tuning, and a maximum new token number of 32 for inference. Table 5 and table 6\ndescribes our hyperparameter search space. We use a lower number of epochs (6 instead of 12) for\nthe commonsense reasoning benchmark because the COMMONSENSE170K training set is more than\n20 times larger than GSM8K.\n\nDuring inference, we use greedy decoding without sampling for the commonsense reasoning bench-\nmark, since it is a multi-token classification benchmark, and use the same decoding strategy as in\nHu et al. [2023] for the arithmetic reasoning benchmark with a higher temperature 0.3. The reason\nto switch to a slightly different set of decoding hyperparameters is that the HuggingFace decoding\nfunction may throw an error due to statistical instability with close-to-zero probabilities over output\ntokens with beam search.8\n\nInstruction following. We finetune LLaMA-7B on Alpaca-52K [Taori et al., 2023] to select hy-\nperparameters. We select the hyperparameter settings based on model performance evaluated with\nAlpaca-Eval v1.0 [Li et al., 2023], which calculates the win-rate over text-davinci-003 by using\ngpt-4-turbo as the annotator. We use a maximum sequence length of 768 for training and hyper-\nparameter tuning, and a maximum new token number of 2048 for inference. Table 7 describes our\nhyperparameter search space.\n\nDuring inference, we use the same decoding strategy as in RED [Wu et al., 2024a] to ensure a fair\ncomparison. Specifically, we use greedy decoding without sampling, and use a maximum repetition\nn-gram size of 5 with a repetition penalty of 1.1.\n\nNatural language understanding. We conduct hyperparameter tuning with RoBERTa-base and\nRoBERTa-large for each task individually. We pick the hyperparameters based on testing performance\non the held-out validation set with a fixed random seed of 42. We then evaluate our model with\nadditional four unseen seeds {43, 44, 45, 46} for final results. We follow Wu et al. [2024a]’s setting\nfor evaluation. For QQP with RoBERTa-large, there are some stochasticity in runs with the same\nseed, so we picked the best run out of 3 runs for any particular seed. As reported by Wu et al. [2024a],\nwe also observe that evaluation results on RTE are unstable due to the small size of the dataset. We\nthus replace several random seeds as in Wu et al. [2024a] to ensure a fair comparison.

Here, we recom-\nmand a non-exhaustive list for choosing the best hyperparameter settings for your tasks:\n\n        • Intervening on multiple positions delivers significant gains. We find that intervening only\n       on a single token position (e.g., just the first one or the last one) is always less optimal than\n         intervening on multiple tokens. However, intervening on excessive number of tokens might\n       harm performance by slowing down convergence.\n        • Intervening on all layers first, and then shrink down. Intervening on all layers often\n        provides a good baseline. We recommand users to start with all layers, and shrink down\n         the number of intervening layers depending on the desired performance–parameter count\n         balance.\n        • Higher rank may not entail better performance. High rank entails higher parameter\n         count, but it does not always bring performance gain (likely due to slower convergence). We\n       recommend users to start with a rank that is lower than 32 (e.g. rank 4).\n        • Tie intervention weights as much as you can. In the paper, we explore tying the interven-\n          tion weights between prefix and suffix token positions. It automatically halves the parameter\n         count, and it can result in better performance as well. We suspect weight sharing across\n         layers may also help.\n        • Hyperparameter tuning with learning rate, warmup ratio, dropout rate and weight\n       decay should go after other hyperparameters. These classic neural-network training\n        hyperparameters can play a role, yet they have much smaller effect than previous ones.\n\nD.3  Additional hyperparameter-tuning results of LoReFT\n\nAs a result of our hyperparameter searching process, LoReFT is trained with more epochs compared to\nLoRA [Hu et al., 2022] or DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c]. This raises the concern whether our performance\ngain is purely due to the larger number of epochs. We thus rerun our experiments with the exact same\nnumber of epochs and effective batch size as LoRA or DoRA. Results are shown in table 14 and\ntable 15. With matched hyperparameters, LoReFT shows similar results by outperforming previous\nmethods significantly on eight commonsense reasoning datasets.\n\nRecently, VeRA was proposed as a new variant of LoRA that further reduces the number of trainable\nparameters while maintaining performance [Kopiczko et al., 2024]. Table 16 shows our results\ncompared against VeRA as well as the baseline numbers reported in VeRA’s paper. We include this\nset of results in the appendix, given that the hyperparameter tuning process is drastically different\nfrom ours.9 The original VeRA implementation records the performance of the best epoch on the\nvalidation set, which could cause overfitting since results are selected based on test set performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n   9VeRA’s original implementation can be found at https://openreview.net/notes/edits/attachment?\nid=D0dcbrnPq0&name=supplementary_material.\n\n\n                                       29\n\nTable 14: Accuracy comparison of LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B against existing PEFT methods on\neight commonsense reasoning datasets. ∗Performance results of all baseline methods are taken from\nLiu et al.

(%) is calculated by dividing the number of trainable parameters by\nthe number of parameters of the base LM. We include LoReFTe=3, which is trained with 3 epochs —\nthe same number of epochs as DoRA, but with a reduced batch size of 16 to ensure an equivalent\nnumber of gradient sets.\n\n                                                                   Accuracy (↑)\n  Model      PEFT         Params (%)\n                                       BoolQ  PIQA  SIQA   HellaS.

(2) are ablated. We reevaluate LLaMA-1 7B and 13B with the same set of hyperparameters on\nthe arithmetic reasoning benchmark using variants of the LoReFT intervention function Φ. We focus\non the arithmetic reasoning benchmark since it is the most difficult for LoReFT and trains relatively\nquickly. We conduct experiments with the following parametrisations:\n\n      1. Φ(h) = h + W⊺2 (W1h + b −W2h) where both W1,W2 ∈Rr×d are low-rank Non-\n        orthogonal linear projection matrices. It has the same trainable parameter count as LoReFT\n         yet with lower memory overhead by removing the orthonormal constraint.\n      2. Φ(h) = h + R⊺(Wh + b) which directly edits the representation in a learned linear\n        subspace.  It has the same trainable parameter count as LoReFT yet with reduced the\n         intervention computation.\n      3. Φ(h) = h + R⊺(b −Rh) which makes the linear subspace intervention a constant bias\n        term that is input-independent. It has only half of the trainable parameter count of LoReFT\n        with less intervention computation.\n      4. Φ(h) = h + R⊺b. This resembles the low-rank subspace bias-only intervention, and is\n         closely related to BitFit [Ben Zaken et al., 2022]. It has only half of the trainable parameter\n        count of LoReFT with less intervention computation.\n\nAs shown in table 17, variants with a similar number of trainable parameters also achieve similar\nperformance to LoReFT across two models.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       32\n\nF  Memorisation experiments\n\nF.1 A single vector is worth a thousand tokens\n\nIn this section, we explore the power of LoReFT through a memorisation test. Similar tests have\nalso been studied in terms of activation-based adversarial attacks in the original basis [Fort, 2023].\nSpecifically, we learn a single rank-1 LoReFT at a single layer on the residual stream of the last\nprompt token to recover a specific output sequence with length Lm. For simplicity, we simplify\nLoReFT in Eqn. 2 by removing Wh to make the intervention input-independent, where we learn\na single scalar b besides the low-rank matrix. As a result, our simplified rank-1 LoReFT contains\nprecisely 4,097 parameters for LLaMA-1 7B and 5,121 parameters for LLaMA-1 13B models.10\nWe measure the memory power by how large Lm can be, and how accurate the recovered output\nsequence is with prefix length exact match in percentage. We use the first few thousand words of\nthe book Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland [Carroll, 1865] as our recovery sequence. Our prompt\nis constructed as ALIC#ID1-> followed by model generations. We train with 1000 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 4 × 10−3 and a linear learning rate scheduler without warm-up.\n\nAs shown in fig. 3 and fig. 4, both models can successfully remember up to 2,048 tokens across\nmost layers with a 100% recovery rate. As a result, a rank-1 intervention can thus correctly recover\na sequence of at least 2,048 in length. LLaMA-1 7B starts to fail catastrophically after the length\nexceeds 2,048, suggesting that positional embeddings might play a role, or the maximum sequence\nlength during pretraining. LLaMA-1 13B shows better memorisation for lengths up to 2,560,\nsuggesting memorisation scales with model size. Note that we may heavily underestimate the model’s\npower of memorisation due to the fact that our hyperparameters are picked with an educated guess\nwithout tuning.\n\nFrom fig. 5 to fig. 8, we conduct harder tests by asking our models to recover a scrambled version\n(word order is scrambled) of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and to recover a random token\nsequence. Recovery rates for these two conditions are significantly worse than the original book,\nsuggesting that pretraining data memorisation may play a role in terms of recovery rate, given that\nthe book is highly likely in the pretraining corpus. Moreover, both models can only recover random\ntoken sequences up to 128 tokens, suggesting that word morphology also plays a role. Our results\nalso suggest that a single rank-1 intervention can transmit over 128 bits of token identity sequence\nusing the hyperparameters we have. 11\n\n\n\n\n\n   10These parameters take about 17.5KB of disk space.\n  11Our code is at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft/tree/main/examples/memorisation.\n\n\n                                       33\n\nFigure 3: Memorisation test results for LLaMA-1 7B model on recovering first n-th tokens of the\nAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland by rank-1 LoReFT intervention on various layers of the last token’s\nresidual stream.

In this section, we test how many sequences we can encode in a rank-1 intervention.\nSpecifically, we attempt to memorise a mapping of input-output pairs at scale, viewing learned\nReFT as a simple index-based storage system. We employ the same intervention and training\nhyperparameters as in appendix F.1, but with a different training dataset. Our prompt is constructed\nas RAND#ID1->, followed by a single output token that the ID maps to. We construct a set of these\ninput-output pairs and train a rank-1 intervention to memorise them.\n\nWe present our results in fig. 9 and fig. 10 for LLaMA-1 7B and 13B, respectively, in terms of how\nmany random input-output pairs a single rank-1 intervention can memorise depending on the layer\nthe intervention in performed in. Our results suggest that a rank-1 intervention can reliably remember\nup to 256 pairs, with near-perfect recall in layer 20 of the 13B model. Recalling the fact that our\nsimplified LoReFT intervention learns only a single scalar b, which is input-dependent, means the\nlearned scalar, when projected back into the original basis, allows the distributed representation of\nthe scalar to enable the model to correctly generate the output token. As a result, it is evidence that\ntoken identities are likely superpositioned in the original basis, and linear decomposition (i.e., our\nlearned projection matrix R) can disentangle superpositioned information to some degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\nG  Capabilities experiments\n\nG.1  Multi-task learning: Learned ReFTs are like puzzle pieces\n\nVarious works have studied how to merge model weights, or PEFT weights together to achieve multi-\ntask learning (MTL) without adaptation [Li et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2023a, Zhang et al., 2024a,\nZhong et al., 2024]. Recent works also explore merging PEFT weights to achieve task composition\n(i.e., generalise to unseen tasks) by detoxifying an instruction-tuned LM [Huang et al., 2023a, Zhang\net al., 2024a]. Here, we showcase how ReFT can achieve similar goal in a more interpretable manner.\nMore importantly, we focus on compositional use of learned abilities (i.e., to combine abilities\ntogether to solve a new task) instead of instilling MTL ability to the model (i.e., to solve different\ntasks). Recall eq. (2), we can further partition our low-rank projection into orthogonal subspaces\ngiven that each column vector of our projection matrix is an orthonormal vector. Formally, we can\nrefine our subspace intervention parameters as ϕi = {Ri,Wi,bi}. R ∈Rri×d where i denotes a\nsubspace partition with a dimension of ri. Each training example now contains an additional field\nindicating its subspace partition to receive gradient updates. At inference time, these partitions can be\nintervened together to test for new task generalisation.\n\nExperiment design. We train a rank-8 LoReFT and partition the subspace into two groups with equal\nrank {0,1,2,3} and {4,5,6,7}. We train the first group for completing any sentence in German.\nSpecifically, we use a the 1K training dataset HellaSwag12 variant which has an English sentence\nprefix and a German completion. We train the second group for instruction following. Specifically, we\nsubsample 1K training examples from Ultrafeedback [Cui et al., 2023]. There is no hyperparameter\ntuning. We train our model for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 5 × 10−3 and a linear learning rate\nscheduler without warm-up. Training finishes under 10 mins with a single Nvidia A100 40G GPU. 13\n\nQualitative results.

However, I must point\n                           out that the question you’ve asked is not accurate. Poodle and Doodle are\n                           not separate dog breeds, but rather a combination of two breeds: Poodle and\n                          Labrador Retriever. So, people may find both Poodle-Labrador Retriever mixes\n                              (also known as Doodles) and purebred Poodles cute.\n                                    It’s important to use accurate language when discussing dog breeds to avoid\n                           confusion and ensure respect for these wonderful animals. I hope this clarifies\n                             things for you! Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n\n  GOODY-2           The question pits two breeds against each other, which could perpetuate the\n                           problematic notion of breed superiority and indirectly support biased breeding\n                             practices that may not prioritize animal welfare.  Additionally, implying a\n                             universal preference could marginalize individual tastes and contribute to the\n                               objectification of living beings based on aesthetic criteria.\n\n\n  Llama-2-chat (LoReFT) Discussing favorites is a great way to spark conversation and find common\n                         ground with others.

Here, we compare\nthe end-to-end inference runtime of a LoReFT LM and a vanilla LM without any intervention (i.e.,\nthe ceiling runtime of any PEFT or ReFT).\n\nExperiment design. We initialise LoReFT with different settings without any training (i.e., the\nintervened LM may generate garbage), and measure its generation runtime with greedy decoding\nwithout any early stopping criteria. The maximum number of new tokens is set to 256. We use a\nmaximum repetition n-gram size of 5 with a repetition penalty of 1.1. We benchmark LoReFT against\na vanilla LM (i.e., un-intervened) with the following conditions with LLaMA-1 7B:\n\n      1. Varying ranks where we fix the intervening layer at layer 15 and the intervening position at\n         the last prompt token. We choose a rank from {1,4,8,16,32}.\n      2. Varying layers where we fix the LoReFT rank to be 8 and the intervening position at the\n           last prompt token. We choose a number of intervening layers from {2,4,6,8,10}.\n      3. Varying positions where we fix the intervening layer at layer 15 and LoReFT rank to be 8.\n      We choose the number of intervening positions n from {2,4,6,8,10}. We only intervening\n       on the last n-th tokens.\n\nQualitative results. We show our results in fig. 11 where we measure the generation time (y-axis)\nfor a fixed length of 256 tokens given different prompt length (x-axis). Overall, ReFT introduces\ncompute overhead during inference as expected. Higher rank or more intervening layers positively\ncorrelate with larger overhead. For intervening with 10 layers with a rank of 8 on the last prompt\ntoken, the overhead is about 0.05 second.\n\n\n\n\n\n  16Our ReFT library is powered by the pyvene Library [Wu et al., 2024b] for performing model interventions.\nDetails about the system design of pyvene can be found in its original paper.\n   17To read more about the KV cache in the HuggingFace library, see https://huggingface.co/docs/\ntransformers/main/en/llm_tutorial_optimization.\n\n\n                                       39\n\nPositionsPositions\n\n\n\n\n\nRankRank\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Time\n\n                                                                                                                                                             Prompt tokens\n\n\nLayersLayers\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Runtime vs. number of prompt tokens across various settings of interventions with LoReFT\ncompared to no intervention.

Examples include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Proto-\n                              col), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and\n                           Telnet.\n                            2. **Transport Layer** - The transport layer ensures reliable delivery of data\n                     by providing error checking and retransmissions if necessary. It also handles\n                        multiplexing and de-multiplexing of data streams. Examples include TCP\n                        (Transmission Control protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n                            3. **Internet Layer** - Also known as the Network Layer, this layer routes\n                         packets from source to destination based on IP addresses. It includes protocols\n                            like IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6).\n                            4. **Data Link Layer** - Responsible for transmitting data over physical links\n                       such as Ethernet or WiFi.  It uses protocols like ARP (Address Resolution\n                          Protocol) and SLIP (Serial Line Interface Protocol).\n                         Please note that some protocols may be implemented at more than one layer in\n                         the TCP/IP stack. For example, DNS (Domain Name System) can operate at\n                        both the application and transport layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                     44\n\nLlama-2 7B (LoReFT,  The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model is a\n1K)                     standard network architecture used to communicate data across the internet or\n                      any other computer network. It consists of four main layers, each with its own\n                             set of protocols:\n                            1. Application Layer: This layer provides services such as email, file transfer,\n                      and web browsing. Examples include SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol),\n                  FTP (File Transfer Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and DNS\n                     (Domain Name System).\n                            2. Transport Layer: This is responsible for establishing and maintaining con-\n                         nections between applications at the application layer.  It ensures that data\n                               is delivered in the correct order and without errors. Examples include TCP\n                        (Transmission ControlProtocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n                            3. Network Layer: This handles routing and forwarding of packets between\n                           different networks.  It also manages addressing schemes like IP addresses\n                            (Internet Protocol Addresses). Examples include IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version\n                         4) and IPv6 (Internet ProtocolVersion 6).\n                            4. Link Layer: This deals with physical communication between devices on a\n                          single network segment. It includes protocols like Ethernet, Token Ring, and\n                         Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).\n\n\n\n\n\n                                     45\n\nInstruction

This qualifies as Rung 2 (Interventional) per the codebook (e.g., DAS interchange, steering vectors). The claim states that a 'linear subspace... can achieve generalised control', using the strong mechanistic verb 'achieve' and implying a functional role ('control over tasks'). This goes beyond causal effect to assert what the mechanism *does*, which aligns with Rung 3 markers like 'performs', 'controls', or 'is responsible for'. There is no hedge (e.g., 'may' or 'suggests'), so hedge_flag=0. The claim is made confidently in the discussion as a conclusion from their interventional results, though it infers a general mechanism from specific interventions, creating a +1 overclaim gap. Confidence is high (5) as both method and claim are clearly defined in the text."
