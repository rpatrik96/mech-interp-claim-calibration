2211.00593,2211.00593-01,presenting an explanation for how GPT-2 small performs a natural language task called indirect object identification (IOI),abstract,3,Path patching (causal intervention) and circuit analysis,2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is path patching, which is a form of activation patching (Rung 2). The claim uses the functional verb 'performs' and frames the work as an 'explanation' of the model's internal behavior. According to the codebook, functional verbs like 'performs' and the mechanistic narrative of 'how' a model works are markers of Rung 3 (Mechanistic/Counterfactual) claims. This creates a +1 gap between the interventional evidence and the mechanistic claim."
2211.00593,2211.00593-02,Our explanation encompasses 26 attention heads grouped into 7 main classes,abstract,3,Path patching and activation patching (causal interventions),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is path patching, which is a form of activation patching (Rung 2). The claim uses the term 'explanation' and groups components into functional 'classes' to describe how the model performs a task, which constitutes a mechanistic narrative (Rung 3). According to the codebook, describing a functional mechanism or 'how' a model performs a task is a Rung 3 claim, creating a +1 gap."
2211.00593,2211.00593-03,this investigation is the largest end-to-end attempt at reverse-engineering a natural behavior,abstract,3,path patching and causal interventions,2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the term 'reverse-engineering', which is explicitly listed in the codebook as a Rung 3 linguistic marker because it implies a complete mechanistic narrative. The methods used (path patching, activation patching, and knockouts) are interventional and establish causal sufficiency, which corresponds to Rung 2. This creates a +1 gap between the method used and the claim made."
2211.00593,2211.00593-04,Name Mover Heads... move the name from the subject to the end position,body,1,Path patching (activation patching variant),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is path patching, which is a causal intervention (Rung 2) that measures the effect of specific activation paths on the output. The claim uses the functional verb 'move', which implies a mechanistic narrative of how the model performs the task (Rung 3). This matches the 'R2 to R3' overclaiming pattern identified in the calibration anchor for this paper."
2211.00593,2211.00593-05,S-Inhibition Heads... inhibit attention from the Name Mover Heads to the S token,body,1,Path patching (causal intervention on the query vector of Name Mover Heads),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is path patching, which is a Rung 2 interventional method that measures causal mediation. The claim uses the functional/mechanistic verb 'inhibit' to describe the specific action of one component on another's internal mechanism (attention). According to the codebook, functional verbs and mechanistic narratives that describe how a model 'performs' or 'uses' components to achieve a specific internal state are classified as Rung 3. This creates a +1 gap between the interventional evidence and the mechanistic claim."
2211.00593,2211.00593-06,the circuit is faithful complete and minimal,abstract,2,"Causal interventions (path patching, knockouts) and quantitative evaluation metrics (faithfulness, completeness, minimality)",2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the definite article 'the circuit' and asserts 'completeness' and 'faithfulness' to the model's internal mechanism, which are Rung 3 mechanistic/uniqueness markers. The methods used (path patching and knockouts) are interventional (Rung 2) as they establish causal sufficiency but do not satisfy the counterfactual uniqueness or absolute necessity required for Rung 3. The paper itself acknowledges that the circuit fails the most challenging completeness tests, yet the abstract claim is stated as a fact."
2202.05262,2202.05262-01,factual associations correspond to localized directly-editable computations,abstract,3,Causal mediation analysis (causal tracing) and Rank-One Model Editing (ROME),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is interventional (R2), involving activation patching (causal tracing) and weight modification (ROME) to establish causal sufficiency. However, the claim uses Rung 3 linguistic markers: it asserts that factual associations 'correspond to' (an identity/mechanistic claim) 'localized computations' (functional attribution). This implies a specific mechanistic structure rather than just causal mediation, creating a +1 gap between the interventional evidence and the mechanistic claim."
2202.05262,2202.05262-02,a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions,abstract,3,Causal mediation analysis (causal tracing) via activation patching,2,2,0,5,0,"The method used is causal tracing, which is a form of activation patching (Rung 2). The claim uses the linguistic marker 'mediate', which is explicitly listed in the codebook as a Rung 2 causal marker. The claim and method are perfectly aligned at Rung 2."
2202.05262,2202.05262-03,mid-layer feed-forward modules... storing factual associations,abstract,3,Causal mediation analysis (causal tracing) and Rank-One Model Editing (ROME),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is interventional (R2), involving activation patching and weight editing to observe causal effects on model output. However, the claim uses the term 'storing', which according to the codebook's decision tree for polysemous terms, is a Rung 3 (Mechanistic) claim because it implies a specific storage mechanism rather than just causal mediation. The gap between the interventional evidence (R2) and the storage/mechanistic claim (R3) constitutes a +1 overclaim."
2202.05262,2202.05262-04,ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction model-editing task,abstract,3,Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) evaluated on zsRE benchmark,2,2,0,5,0,"The method (ROME) is an interventional weight-editing technique (Rung 2). The claim uses the term 'effective' to describe the performance of this intervention on a specific task (zsRE). According to the codebook, claims about the result of an intervention or its effectiveness are Rung 2. There is no overclaim here as the claim rung matches the method rung."
2301.05217,2301.05217-01,We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks,abstract,3,"Ablation in Fourier space, weight analysis, and activation analysis",2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the phrase 'fully reverse engineer' and 'the algorithm', which are explicit Rung 3 linguistic markers indicating a complete mechanistic and unique functional attribution. The methods used (Fourier ablation) are interventional (Rung 2) but do not establish counterfactual uniqueness or necessity to the level required for a Rung 3 claim, creating a +1 gap."
2301.05217,2301.05217-02,uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation,abstract,3,Ablation in Fourier space and weight/activation analysis,2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses functional/mechanistic verbs ('uses', 'convert') to describe a specific algorithm. While the paper provides interventional evidence (Rung 2) via Fourier ablations to show these components are necessary, the claim is framed as a complete mechanistic narrative of how the model performs the task (Rung 3). This matches the 'Grokking' calibration case in the codebook."
2301.05217,2301.05217-03,grokking arises from the gradual amplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights,abstract,3,Ablation in Fourier space and weight/activation analysis,2,3,1,5,0,The method is classified as Rung 2 because the authors use Fourier-space ablations to establish causal necessity of specific frequencies. The claim is classified as Rung 3 because it uses the term 'encoded' in a mechanistic sense (referring to the underlying structure of the algorithm) and describes the 'mechanism' as the source of the behavior. This matches the R2 to R3 overclaiming pattern identified in the calibration rationales for this specific paper.
2409.04478,2409.04478-01,SAEs struggle to reach the neuron baseline,abstract,3,Interchange intervention on SAE features and neurons,2,2,0,5,0,"The method used is interchange intervention (a form of activation patching), which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim 'struggle to reach the neuron baseline' refers to the comparative performance of these features in mediating the model's behavior during those interventions. This is a causal sufficiency claim (Rung 2) rather than a mechanistic or uniqueness claim (Rung 3)."
2409.04478,2409.04478-02,sets of SAE features that separately mediate knowledge of which country a city is in,abstract,3,Interchange intervention on SAE features using Differential Binary Masking (DBM),2,2,0,5,0,"The method uses interchange interventions (patching) to measure the effect of specific feature sets on model output, which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim uses the term 'mediate', which is the specific linguistic marker for Rung 2 causal claims according to the codebook. Therefore, the claim is perfectly calibrated to the method."
2601.11516,2601.11516-01,activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique,abstract,3,Linear probing,1,1,0,5,1,The claim is associational/observational (R1) as it describes probes as a 'promising technique' for a task (mitigation) without asserting a specific internal mechanism or causal necessity. The method used in the prior work cited for this specific abstract claim is linear probing (R1). The claim is explicitly hedged with the word 'may'.
2601.11516,2601.11516-02,probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts,abstract,3,"Linear probing and novel probe architectures (MultiMax, Rolling Attention) evaluated on distribution shifts (long-context, multi-turn).",1,1,0,5,0,"The method used is observational (Rung 1) because it involves training and evaluating probes on frozen activations without intervening on the model's internal state to change behavior. The claim is associational (Rung 1) because 'fail to generalize' refers to the predictive performance/accuracy of the probes on new distributions, which is a statement about the limits of the associational evidence extracted by the probes."
2304.14997,2304.14997-01,reverse-engineered nontrivial behaviors of transformer models,abstract,3,activation patching,2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the term 'reverse-engineered', which is a Rung 3 linguistic marker indicating a complete mechanistic understanding of an algorithm. The method used to support this (and the paper's focus) is activation patching, which is an interventional method (Rung 2) that establishes causal sufficiency but not the unique mechanistic necessity required for Rung 3."
2304.14997,2304.14997-02,ACDC algorithm rediscovered 5/5 of the component types in a circuit,abstract,3,Automatic Circuit DisCovery (ACDC) / Activation Patching,2,1,0,5,0,"The method used (ACDC) is based on activation patching, which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim itself is purely associational/observational (Rung 1) because it simply states that the algorithm 'rediscovered' or identified the same components as previous work, without making a functional or causal claim about the components' roles in this specific sentence."
2304.14997,2304.14997-03,researchers can understand the functionality of each component,abstract,3,activation patching,2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the functional/mechanistic term 'understand the functionality', which corresponds to Rung 3 (Mechanistic/Counterfactual). The method described in the abstract context is activation patching, which is a Rung 2 (Interventional) method. This represents a +1 gap (overclaim) typical of mechanistic interpretability papers that use causal interventions to support functional narratives."
2304.14997,2304.14997-04,finding the connections between abstract neural network units that form a circuit,abstract,3,Activation patching (ACDC algorithm),2,3,1,5,0,"The method (ACDC) is based on activation patching, which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim uses the term 'circuit', which according to the codebook's decision tree for polysemous terms, is classified as Rung 3 (mechanistic/uniqueness claim) because it implies a functional subgraph responsible for a behavior."
2407.14008,2407.14008-01,partially reverse-engineer the circuit responsible for the Indirect Object Identification task,abstract,3,"Resample ablation, Edge Attribution Patching (EAP), and Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC)",2,3,1,5,1,"The claim uses the term 'reverse-engineer' and 'the circuit responsible for', which are Rung 3 linguistic markers implying a functional/mechanistic narrative and a unique causal structure. The methods used (ablation and patching) are interventional (Rung 2) as they establish causal sufficiency but do not prove uniqueness or a complete counterfactual mechanism. The author includes the hedge 'partially', but per the codebook, the underlying claim remains Rung 3."
2407.14008,2407.14008-02,Layer 39 is a key bottleneck,abstract,3,"Zero and Resample ablation, Layer Removal, and minimal cross-talk subset computation",2,3,1,5,0,"The authors use interventional methods (Rung 2) such as resample ablation and layer removal to show that Layer 39 is necessary for the task. However, the claim that it is a 'key bottleneck' is a mechanistic/functional attribution (Rung 3) that implies a specific structural role in the model's internal algorithm. According to the codebook, functional descriptions of a component's role ('bottleneck', 'responsible for') are Rung 3, creating a +1 gap."
2407.14008,2407.14008-03,Convolutions in layer 39 shift names one position forward,abstract,3,Resample ablation on individual convolution slices,2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is resample ablation (interchange intervention) on specific convolution slices to test the effect on logit difference, which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim uses the functional verb 'shift', which describes a specific mechanistic operation/algorithm performed by the component, making it a Rung 3 claim. This follows the 'performs/computes' functional attribution rule in the codebook."
2407.14008,2407.14008-04,The name entities are stored linearly in Layer 39's SSM,abstract,3,Activation modification (Replace/Subtract and Add) and Cosine Similarity,2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the term 'stored' to describe how entities are represented in the SSM, which is a Rung 3 mechanistic/storage claim according to the codebook. The evidence provided in Section 4.3 involves 'Replace' and 'Subtract and Add' methods (interchange interventions/activation patching) which establish causal sufficiency (Rung 2), but do not prove the unique storage mechanism or counterfactual necessity required for Rung 3. This follows the 'ROME' calibration pattern where interventional evidence is used to support a 'storage' claim."
2501.17148,2501.17148-01,prompting outperforms all existing methods followed by finetuning,abstract,3,LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of steered outputs,2,2,0,5,0,"The method used is model steering (intervention-based) evaluated by an LLM judge on three axes (concept, instruct, fluency). This is a Rung 2 method because it measures the causal effect of interventions on model behavior. The claim 'outperforms' refers to the empirical performance on these Rung 2 metrics (causal efficacy) rather than a mechanistic or counterfactual claim about internal structure, making it a Rung 2 claim."
2501.17148,2501.17148-02,SAEs are not competitive,abstract,3,SAE feature attribution and steering evaluation,2,1,0,5,0,"The claim 'SAEs are not competitive' is an associational/observational claim (Rung 1) about the performance of a method relative to baselines on a benchmark. While the evidence used to support this includes interventional steering (Rung 2), the claim itself is a comparative performance statement rather than a causal or mechanistic one. It describes the empirical result of the benchmark (Rung 1) without making a claim about the model's internal causal structure or unique mechanisms."
2501.17148,2501.17148-03,representation-based methods such as difference-in-means perform the best,abstract,3,"Difference-in-means (DiffMean) and other representation-based methods (Probe, ReFT-r1)",1,1,0,5,0,"The claim refers specifically to 'concept detection' performance (AUROC) as measured in the benchmark. In the context of this paper, concept detection is an associational task where a classifier (like DiffMean or a Probe) is used to predict labels from frozen activations. This is a Rung 1 method supporting a Rung 1 claim about predictive performance."
2404.03646,2404.03646-01,specific components within middle layers show strong causal effects at the last token of the subject,abstract,3,Causal tracing (activation patching),2,2,0,5,0,"The method used is activation patching (causal tracing), which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim uses the linguistic marker 'causal effects', which is the standard Rung 2 marker for interventional results. There is no overclaim as the claim rung matches the method rung."
2404.03646,2404.03646-02,rank-one model editing methods can successfully insert facts at specific locations,abstract,3,ROME (Rank-One Model Editing),2,2,0,5,0,"The method used is ROME, which is an interventional weight-modification technique (Rung 2). The claim uses the verb 'insert', which in the context of model editing refers to the successful causal outcome of the intervention (causal sufficiency) rather than a claim about the model's unique internal mechanism or counterfactual necessity. This aligns with Rung 2."
2404.03646,2404.03646-03,linearity of Mamba's representations of factual relations,body,1,Linearity of Relation Embedding (LRE) / Jacobian-based first-order Taylor approximation,1,3,2,5,0,"The method (LRE) is a correlational/associational technique that uses linear approximations (Jacobians) to see if information is decodable or present in a linear subspace (Rung 1). The claim uses the term 'representations', which, according to the polysemous terms decision tree, defaults to Rung 3 (mechanistic) unless the context explicitly limits it to 'decodability'. Here, the paper frames it as an investigation into the 'internal mechanisms' and 'how LMs extract this information', moving it into the mechanistic narrative category."
2505.14685,2505.14685-01,LM binds each character-object-state triple together by co-locating their reference information,abstract,3,Causal Abstraction with Interchange Interventions and Desiderata-based Component Masking (DCM),2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the functional/mechanistic verb 'binds' and describes a specific internal structural operation ('co-locating reference information') to explain how the model represents data. According to the codebook, functional attribution and mechanistic narratives are Rung 3. The evidence provided is based on activation patching (interchange interventions) and subspace masking (DCM), which are Rung 2 interventional methods that establish causal sufficiency but not the unique mechanistic necessity required for Rung 3."
2505.14685,2505.14685-02,lookback mechanism which enables the LM to recall important information,abstract,3,Causal Mediation Analysis (Interchange Interventions / Activation Patching),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is activation patching (interchange interventions), which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim uses the functional/mechanistic verb 'enables the LM to recall', which implies a specific internal algorithm or mechanism (Rung 3). According to the codebook, functional verbs like 'recalls' or 'performs' are Rung 3 linguistic markers, creating a +1 gap between the interventional evidence and the mechanistic claim."
2505.14685,2505.14685-03,the binding lookback retrieves the correct state OI,abstract,3,Causal Abstraction / Interchange Interventions (Activation Patching),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is activation patching (interchange interventions) on specific subspaces, which is a Rung 2 interventional method. The claim uses the functional verb 'retrieves' and describes a specific mechanistic step ('the binding lookback retrieves...') as part of a larger 'reverse-engineering' narrative. According to the codebook, functional verbs and mechanistic narratives are markers of Rung 3 claims."
2510.06182,2510.06182-01,LMs implement such retrieval via a positional mechanism,abstract,3,Interchange interventions (activation patching),2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the functional verb 'implement' to describe how the model performs a task, which is a Rung 3 mechanistic/functional attribution. The paper identifies this as the 'prevailing view' based on prior work using activation patching (Rung 2). The paper's own evidence also relies on interchange interventions (Rung 2) to test this mechanism, creating a +1 gap between the interventional evidence and the mechanistic claim."
2510.06182,2510.06182-02,LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism and a reflexive mechanism,abstract,3,Interchange interventions (activation patching) and causal abstraction modeling,2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is interchange intervention (Rung 2), which establishes causal sufficiency. However, the claim uses the term 'mechanism' and describes how the model 'supplements' one with others to 'drive model behavior,' which constitutes a functional/mechanistic narrative (Rung 3). According to the codebook, describing 'the mechanism' or 'how it works' beyond the result of the intervention is a Rung 3 claim."
2510.06182,2510.06182-03,causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token distributions with 95% agreement,body,1,Causal abstraction/Interchange intervention,2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is interchange intervention (Rung 2), which establishes causal sufficiency. The claim uses the term 'causal model' and 'mechanisms' to describe how the model 'estimates' distributions, which falls under Rung 3 (mechanistic narrative/functional attribution). The codebook specifically identifies 'causal model' and 'mechanism' as R3 markers when uniqueness or complete functional explanation is implied, as seen in the calibration cases for Grokking and IOI."
2510.06182,2510.06182-04,how LMs bind and retrieve entities in-context,abstract,3,Interchange interventions (activation patching) and causal abstraction modeling,2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the functional/mechanistic verb 'bind' and 'retrieve' to describe the model's internal operations. According to the codebook, 'how' a model performs a task and functional verbs like 'retrieve' or 'bind' (similar to 'encodes' or 'computes') constitute Rung 3 mechanistic claims. The evidence provided is based on interchange interventions (activation patching), which are Rung 2 methods. This creates a +1 gap (R2 to R3 overclaim), similar to the IOI calibration anchor."
2411.16105,2411.16105-01,circuits within LLMs may be more flexible and general than previously recognized,abstract,3,Path patching and circuit discovery on prompt variants,2,3,1,5,1,The authors use path patching (Rung 2) to identify circuit components. The claim that circuits are 'flexible and general' is a mechanistic/functional attribution (Rung 3) about the nature of the underlying algorithm. The use of 'may be' is an explicit hedge.
2411.16105,2411.16105-02,the circuit generalizes surprisingly well reusing all of its components and mechanisms,abstract,3,Path patching and circuit discovery (re-extracting circuits on prompt variants),2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses mechanistic language ('reusing all of its components and mechanisms') and refers to 'the circuit' as a functional entity. According to the codebook, functional attribution and mechanistic narratives are Rung 3. The method used is path patching (a variant of activation patching), which is an interventional method classified as Rung 2. This creates a +1 gap (R2 to R3), similar to the IOI calibration anchor."
2411.16105,2411.16105-03,we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2 Hacking,abstract,3,Path patching and attention analysis on circuit components,2,3,1,5,0,"The authors use path patching (R2) to identify why the circuit behaves differently from the model. However, the claim uses the term 'mechanism' and 'explains' to provide a functional narrative of how the circuit operates, which falls under Rung 3 (Mechanistic/Counterfactual) according to the codebook's linguistic markers and decision trees for mechanistic narratives."
2411.16105,2411.16105-04,implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks,abstract,3,Activation patching (path patching),2,3,1,5,0,"The claim uses the functional/mechanistic verbs 'implement' and 'performing' to describe the relationship between circuits and tasks. According to the codebook, functional attribution and mechanistic narratives are Rung 3. The method used throughout the paper to identify these circuits is path patching (a variant of activation patching), which is an interventional method classified as Rung 2. This creates a +1 gap (R2 to R3)."
2402.17700,2402.17700-01,MDAS achieves state-of-the-art results on RAVEL demonstrating the importance of going beyond neuron-level analyses to identify features distributed across activations,abstract,3,Multi-task Distributed Alignment Search (MDAS),2,3,1,5,0,"The method (MDAS) is an interventional technique based on interchange interventions (activation patching), which establishes causal sufficiency (Rung 2). The claim uses the term 'identify features', which, according to the codebook's decision tree for polysemous terms like 'represents/encodes/identifies', is treated as a Rung 3 mechanistic claim by default unless the context limits it to linear decodability. Furthermore, the claim asserts that these features are 'distributed across activations', making a functional attribution about the model's internal representational structure (Rung 3)."
2402.17700,2402.17700-02,If this leads the LM to output Asia instead of Europe then we have evidence that the feature F encodes the attribute continent,introduction,2,Interchange Intervention (Activation Patching),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is interchange intervention, which is a form of activation patching (Rung 2). The claim uses the term 'encodes', which according to the codebook decision tree for polysemous terms, defaults to Rung 3 (mechanistic) unless the context specifies a decodability/probing sense. Here, the context is a mechanistic narrative about how the model represents and uses attributes, and the paper elsewhere claims to 'localize' and 'reverse-engineer' these features, confirming a Rung 3 interpretation."
2402.17700,2402.17700-03,Methods with counterfactual supervision achieve strong results while methods with unsupervised featurizers struggle,results,1,"Multi-task Distributed Alignment Search (MDAS), Distributed Alignment Search (DAS), Differential Binary Masking (DBM), Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",2,2,0,5,0,"The claim compares the performance of different methods on the RAVEL benchmark. The benchmark's primary metric is the 'Disentangle score', which is derived from interchange interventions (activation patching). According to the codebook, activation patching is a Rung 2 method. The claim itself is an empirical observation about the relative effectiveness ('achieve strong results') of these methods in producing causal effects on model behavior, which aligns with Rung 2 (causal sufficiency/influence)."
2402.17700,2402.17700-04,The representations of different attributes gradually disentangle as we move towards later layers,results,1,Multi-task Distributed Alignment Search (MDAS),2,3,1,5,0,"The method (MDAS) is an interventional technique based on interchange interventions (activation patching), which establishes causal sufficiency (Rung 2). The claim uses the term 'representations' and describes a mechanistic narrative of how attributes 'disentangle' across layers, which constitutes a functional/mechanistic claim (Rung 3) about the model's internal organization. This creates a +1 gap (R2 to R3)."
2402.17700,2402.17700-05,Some groups of attributes are more difficult to disentangle than others... Changing one of these entangled attributes has seemingly unavoidable ripple effects,results,1,Multi-task Distributed Alignment Search (MDAS) / Interchange Intervention,2,3,1,5,1,"The method used is MDAS, which is a form of interchange intervention (activation patching) used to find causal subspaces. This is a Rung 2 method. The claim uses the phrase 'unavoidable ripple effects' and 'difficult to disentangle' to describe the underlying structure of the model's representations. According to the codebook, claims about how the model 'is' structured or the nature of its internal 'mechanism' (even when describing entanglement) are Rung 3. The word 'seemingly' acts as a hedge."
2404.03592,2404.03592-01,much prior interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich semantic information,abstract,3,Linear probing / Activation logging (referenced prior work),1,3,2,5,0,"The claim uses the polysemous term 'encode' to describe the relationship between representations and semantic information. According to the decision tree for 'encode', since the context refers to 'prior interpretability work' (typically probing or activation analysis in this context) and the authors use this as a motivation for a 'mechanistic' hypothesis about editing, it functions as a Rung 3 claim. The codebook specifically lists 'representations encode X' as a Rung 3 linguistic marker (functional/mechanistic attribution)."
2404.03592,2404.03592-02,interventions on linear subspaces of representations have provided increasing evidence that human-interpretable concepts are encoded linearly,introduction,2,Interventional interpretability (Distributed Interchange Intervention/DAS),2,3,1,5,0,"The method described (interventions on linear subspaces) corresponds to Rung 2 (Interventional). However, the claim uses the term 'encoded', which according to the polysemous terms decision tree in the codebook, defaults to Rung 3 (mechanistic) unless the context specifies a decodability/probing sense. Here, the context links the intervention to the internal representation mechanism, making it a Rung 3 claim."

However, the claim uses the term 'encoded' (Rung 3) to describe the relationship. According to the polysemous terms decision tree, 'encoded' is coded as R3 by default unless the context explicitly limits it to 'linearly decodable from'. Here, the context is a mechanistic narrative about how the model represents contextual information, making it a Rung 3 claim supported only by Rung 1 evidence."

By adopting the terminology of 'localization' to describe the underlying phenomenon of where facts are stored/represented, the authors are making a Rung 3 claim about the model's internal organization. The methods used (ROME and Causal Tracing) are interventional (Rung 2), as they establish causal sufficiency for an output change but do not inherently prove unique storage or the complete mechanism."

While the paper uses steering (R2) to validate these features, the claim itself is a mechanistic narrative about how the model represents information. The method rung is 2 because the paper uses interventional steering to identify and rank features, but does not perform the full counterfactual/uniqueness tests required for Rung 3."

The claim uses the term 'identifies strategy-specific features', which according to the codebook's decision tree for 'encodes/represents/identifies', constitutes a Rung 3 mechanistic claim (functional attribution) because it asserts the discovery of the specific internal components responsible for a behavior without proving uniqueness or counterfactual necessity."

However, the claim uses Rung 3 linguistic markers ('measuring... effective degrees of freedom', 'represents') to describe the underlying mechanism of how the model organizes information.

The paper supports this by training probes (XGBoost, etc.) on the SAE reconstructions and measuring performance (F1 score) on binary classification tasks. According to the codebook, claims about 'usefulness' or 'performance' in downstream tasks supported by interventions (like replacing activations with SAE reconstructions to see if task information is preserved) are Rung 2. The claim is causal in the sense that the method (incorporating symmetries) produces a result (better features for tasks), which is a claim of causal sufficiency for task performance."

According to the polysemous terms decision tree in the codebook, 'controls' is classified as Rung 3 (Mechanistic) unless the paper explicitly qualifies it as non-unique causal sufficiency. Since the abstract states 'steering effectively controls' as a general functional property of the model's internals, it is coded as Rung 3, creating a +1 gap."

The claim is that high steering strengths 'degrade' text quality.

The paper uses the 'Causal Abstraction' framework, which is defined in the codebook as a Rung 3 method (Counterfactual/Mechanistic) because it aims to establish the unique/necessary structure of a mechanism. The claim itself uses mechanistic language ('underpins', 'implementation') to describe how one system realizes the algorithm of another, which aligns with Rung 3's focus on functional attribution and mechanistic narratives."

While the method described—causal abstraction—relies on interventional evidence (Rung 2), the claim is about the fundamental nature of how a system 'implements' or 'computes' (Rung 3).

The claim uses the term 'encoded', which according to the codebook decision tree for polysemous terms, defaults to Rung 3 (mechanistic) unless the context specifies a decodability/probing sense. Here, the authors use the intervention to build a mechanistic narrative about the sequential processing order of the model's internal computations ('first resolving output language, then the concept'), which is a Rung 3 claim."

The claim uses the term 'existence of language-agnostic concept representations', which is a Rung 3 mechanistic claim. According to the codebook decision tree for 'represents/representations', if the evidence is interventional but the claim describes the underlying mechanism (how the model stores/organizes information) rather than just the result of the intervention, it is coded as R3.

2507.20936,2507.20936-02,these layers transform persona tokens into richer representations which are then used by middle MHA layers,abstract,3,Activation patching (Resample Ablation),2,3,1,5,0,"The method used is activation patching (Rung 2), which establishes causal mediation. However, the claim uses mechanistic/functional language ('transform', 'used by') to describe a specific internal process and narrative of how information flows between components.

According to the codebook, attention visualization is a Rung 1 method (observational). The linguistic marker 'attend to' is equivalent to 'concentrates on' or 'activates on', which are Rung 1 markers for associational/observational evidence.

The claim uses the patching results to conclude that 'associative knowledge is distributed'. According to the codebook, claims about how knowledge is 'distributed' or 'represented' (mechanistic narrative) are classified as Rung 3. This follows the R2 -> R3 overclaim pattern where causal sufficiency from patching is used to make a definitive claim about the underlying architectural representation of knowledge."

The claim uses the term 'localised' to describe how 'definitional knowledge' is stored/represented based on that intervention. According to the codebook decision tree for 'localised' and 'knowledge representation', claims that move from causal sufficiency (restoring accuracy) to a statement about the underlying mechanism or storage of knowledge are classified as Rung 3. This follows the ROME calibration example where localization claims are treated as Rung 3 mechanistic interpretations of Rung 2 causal evidence."

The claim, however, uses mechanistic language ('knowledge... is localized', 'depends on distributed representations') to describe how the model stores or organizes information.

According to the codebook, SAE feature attribution and activation logging are Rung 1 (Observational/Associational) because they identify what features activate without intervening on the model's computation. The claim uses the term 'interpret' and 'universal concept space' to describe the internal activations, which falls under Rung 3 (Mechanistic) as it provides a functional/mechanistic narrative of how the model represents information. The gap between the observational evidence (reconstruction) and the mechanistic claim (interpreting the space) represents a +2 overclaim."

While the paper uses reconstruction error (R2) to validate the dictionary, this remains an associational/observational method (Rung 1) as it identifies features that can reconstruct activations without intervening on the model's computation to prove causal necessity. The claim uses the term 'captures common factors of variation—concepts', which according to the codebook's decision tree for 'concepts' and 'factors of variation' in a mechanistic context, implies a Rung 3 functional/mechanistic claim about what the model internals represent."

The claim uses the verb 'discover' and 'universal concepts', which falls under the Rung 3 category of functional/mechanistic attribution (representing/encoding). Specifically, the codebook identifies 'SAE -> represents' or 'SAE -> concepts' as a +2 overclaim (R1 to R3)."

The evidence provided in the paper for this specific claim comes from attention knockout (Rung 2 interventional) and attention visualization (Rung 1 observational). Since the method involves interventions (knockout) but the claim describes the underlying functional mechanism of the model, it is a Rung 2 to Rung 3 overclaim."
